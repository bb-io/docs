A Blackbird App connects an application to the vast Blackbird ecosystem using its API. An App consists of events and/or actions that allow the user to orchestrate workflows. You can manage and set up _Apps_ in the Apps screen of Blackbird.io.

## Browsing Apps

Blackbird is rolling out the red carpet with a constant stream of Public Apps. If we donâ€™t have an app pre-built, you can build it yourself - using Blackbird's SDK.

1. On the top navigation bar, click _Apps_.
2. Click on an App to view or edit its details.

| Connections     | Connections are the wiring of apps. Birds authorize their interactions with other apps or services through connections. |
| Events          | Things can happen inside the app you're conencted to. We call this an event. Events trigger your Birds when to fly.     |
| Actions         | Actions are tasks that birds will perform once a trigger activates them.                                                |
| Version history | This tab lists the version history of the App.                                                                          |
