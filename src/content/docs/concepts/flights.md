The Flights tab gives you an overview about how your Birds perform. The list displays the latest 50 flights from the last thirty days. You can use the search bar to narrow down the results by typing in the Bird name or the Flight ID. You can also filter the list by the latest, failed, running, or succeeded flights.

## Checking the details of a flight

To check your flights, navigate to the _Flights_ tab and click on a flight in the list to check its details. In this overview you can check each individual action, their inputs and their outputs. You will see a message if an action failed.

You can click _EditBird_ to open the editor page of the current Bird, where you can make the necessary edits.
