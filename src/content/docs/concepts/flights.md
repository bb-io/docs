The Flights tab gives you an overview about how your Birds perform. The list displays the latest 500 flights from the last thirty days. You can use the search bar to narrow down the results by typing in the Bird's name or the Flight ID, or even check flights from an specific date range. You can also filter the list by flights' state: completed, stopped, failed, flying or waiting.

## Checking the details of a flight

To check your flights, navigate to the _Flights_ tab and click on a Flight in the list to check its details. In this overview you can check each individual action, their inputs and their outputs.

When a flight fails, a message containing the error details is displayed:

By clicking _Edit Bird_ you can open the editor page of the current Bird, where you can make the necessary changes.

## Live flights

You can watch a flight in real time as a _bird flies_ through the steps of your workflow. A flapping bird animation guides you along the path, moving from one step to the next as they execute. Once the flight completes successfully, a burst of confetti gives you a visual high five.

## Parallel flights

While a Bird can produce an unlimited number of flights, we’ve introduced a limit on how many can fly in parallel. This does not affect the total number of executions or the amount of data processed, but it does control how many flights can start at the exact same time. If you trigger more flights than your subscription allows to run concurrently, the extra ones will queue up and execute as soon as capacity becomes available. You can monitor these queued flights using the `Waiting` filter in the _Flights_ tab. The parallel execution limits depend on your subscription: the Team plan allows up to 6 concurrent flights, the Business plan allows 12, and the Enterprise plan supports unlimited parallel executions.

## Stop a flight

To end a Flight that hasn’t completed yet, use the `Stop Flight` button next to the Bird’s name when viewing that specific flight under the _Flights_ tab.
