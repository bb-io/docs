It's Blackbird's ambition to become the most innovative company in the translation industry. We want to give you the perfect technology to start orchestrating your content-driven workflows and be the bridge between content, language and AI.

Our key metric is the time it takes you to set up your workflow, and we will implement more and more features to make that process as easy as possible.
Furthermore, we know exactly what problems you may face when it comes to language and content. We will make sure we have a solution that always works for you.

Our philosophy is and always will be: make it as easy as possible for you without being opinionated or being a bottleneck.

## Q4 2024

<Card title="Flight page rework" icon="rocket">
  We want to make the flight page, where you can inspect your bird's past flights, a delight to use. The ultimate user experienc here would be a live view of your flights even down to each flight showing which action is being executed in real time!

## Q1 2025

<Card title="Easy bird creation (or blueprints)" icon="sun">
  The time it takes to build a bird is our most important metric. We know that templates for birds would provide great user experience and inspiration for you to leverage the most out of Blackbird.
  We are excited to build an interactive blueprint system that gives you this inspiration, sets up birds for you with the apps that you use, and will always generate birds that are up-to-date with the latest powerful features Blackbird has to offer.
