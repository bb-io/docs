import { Card, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

It's Blackbird's ambition to become the most innovative company in the translation industry. We want to give you the perfect technology to start orchestrating your content-driven workflows and be the bridge between content, language and AI.

Our key metric is the time it takes you to set up your workflow, and we will implement more and more features to make that process as easy as possible.
Furthermore, we know exactly what problems you may face when it comes to language and content. We will make sure we have a solution that always works for you.

Our philosophy is and always will be: make it as easy as possible for you to build the most efficient processes imaginable.

## Summer & early fall 2025

<Card title="Bird editor rework" icon="sun">
  This summer, we're focused on enhancing the Bird editor in Blackbird. Our goal is to make the editing experience more intuitive and efficient. Expect a cleaner interface, smarter interactions, and overall improvements that make building and managing workflows faster and easier than they already are.
  Our remaining upcoming releases will include improved connection management, a file/folder picker and more ergonomic inputs.
</Card>

<Card title="Fly again" icon="rocket">
  We will add the ability to retrigger previous Flights. This is useful when you want to make small changes to your Bird and restart a process without having to manually trigger the process from a different application.
</Card>

## Q4 2025

The final months of 2025 our goals are to keep working on anticipatory design for the Bird editor. Besides that, we are planning to make serious upgrades to our engine.

<Card title="Smart input values" icon="heart">
  Sometimes the amount of options you have can be overwhelming. We will start suggesting input values based on common patterns to you.
</Card>

<Card title="Implicit loops" icon="right-arrow">
  Loop logic can sometimes be hard if you don't work with them every day. We're looking to make working with loops even easier.
</Card>

<Card title="New engine" icon="setting">
  The team is working hard to release a new processing engine for Blackbird. Not only will this increase stability and performance, it will also allow us to work on smarter Bird patterns in the next year!
</Card>

## 2026

<Card title="Multiple decisions" icon="approve-check">
  With the new engine, we can give you the ability to not create arbitrary true/false decisions. Instead, you can go much wider! Make decisions based on values and create multiple branches for each.
</Card>

<Card title="Parallel checkpoints" icon="random">
  Checkpoints today are a unique and amazing future of Blackbird as they allow you to wait for human decisions, input or results from long running processes. We aim to improve this functionality by allowing you to wait for multiple events at once. The prime use case for this is to deliver translated language variants back immediatly rather than waiting for the entire project to be finished.
</Card>

<Card title="Bird history & rollback" icon="bars">
  "Who edited this Bird?". "I published, made a mistake, can I go back?". Soon you will be able to track your Bird changes and revert to any previous state of your Bird.
</Card>

<Card title="Semantic app versioning" icon="open-book">
  Not all updates introduce breaking changes. We're looking to improve the App update management of your Birds.
</Card>

Besides these highlighted updates, expect much more to come in 2025!
