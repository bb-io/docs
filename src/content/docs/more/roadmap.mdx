It's Blackbird's ambition to become the most innovative company in the translation industry. We want to give you the perfect technology to start orchestrating your content-driven workflows and be the bridge between content, language and AI.

Our key metric is the time it takes you to set up your workflow, and we will implement more and more features to make that process as easy as possible.
Furthermore, we know exactly what problems you may face when it comes to language and content. We will make sure we have a solution that always works for you.

Our philosophy is and always will be: make it as easy as possible for you without being opinionated or being a bottleneck.

## Summer 2025

  This summer, we're focused on enhancing the Bird editor in Blackbird. Our goal is to make the editing experience more intuitive and efficient. Expect a cleaner interface, smarter interactions, and overall improvements that make building and managing workflows faster and easier than they already are.
