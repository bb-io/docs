The Blackbird SDK can be installed manually, but the fastest way to get started with Blackbird is using the Blackbird.io template app. This repository serves as an example of how to write apps for the Blackbird platform.

## Prerequisites

- Git installed on your local machine. For this tutorial we assume you have a basic understanding of Git.
- Install Visual Studio 2022 for Windows with the .NET desktop development workload. You can [download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and install the 2022 Community edition for free, or use the Professional or Enterprise edition. Alternatively you can use any other .NET IDE environment like Rider or VS Code with the necessary plugins.
