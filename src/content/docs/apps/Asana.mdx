## Example

![Asana example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/Asana/main//README/images/example.png)

In this example, we have a workflow that triggers when tasks are added to a project. The workflow then retrieves the task details and sends them to a Slack channel.

## Missing features

In the future we can add actions for:

- Portfolios
- Project briefs
- Teams
