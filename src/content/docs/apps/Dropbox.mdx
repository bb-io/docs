Dropbox is a cloud-based file hosting service that allows users to store, share, and synchronize files across different devices and platforms. It enables users to access their files from anywhere with an internet connection, making it a convenient solution for individuals, teams, and businesses to collaborate on documents, photos, videos, and other types of files.

## Connecting

2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My Dropbox connection'.
4. Click _Authorize connection_.
5. As a new window pops up, follow the instructions from Dropbox.
