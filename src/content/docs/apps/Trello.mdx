Trello is a web-based project management and collaboration tool that organizes tasks into visual boards. It allows users to create boards for different projects or tasks, and within each board, users can create lists to represent stages or categories, and cards to represent individual tasks or items. Users can move cards between lists to track progress, add descriptions, checklists, due dates, attachments, and assign them to team members. Trello is known for its intuitive and flexible interface, making it popular among individuals, teams, and organizations for managing various types of projects, from software development to event planning to personal task management
