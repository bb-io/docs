Google Translate is a multilingual neural machine translation service developed by Google to translate text, documents and websites from one language into another.

## Before setting up

You can connect the Google Translate app to Google Cloud using either a Service Account key or Workload Identity Federation (WIF).

### Service account key

- Create or use an existing service account in Google Cloud Console (IAM & Admin → Service accounts)

- Generate a key for for the service account in JSON format.

- Copy key (JSON file full contents) and paste into the "Client configuration JSON string" field during connection.

### Workload Identity Federation (keyless WIF)

- Blackbird supports WIF to obtain short‑lived Google credentials without storing service account keys.

- Typical setup:

	1. In Google Cloud, create a Workload Identity Pool and an OIDC Provider.
	2. Configure the Provider to accept the Azure tokens described below.
	3. Grant the target Google service account the role Workload Identity User, binding it to the provider/attribute conditions.
	4. In Blackbird, create a WIF connection using the dedicated WIF client configuration (see "Connecting" below).

- Azure parameters used by Blackbird:

	- Issuer (URL): `https://sts.windows.net/832b2f36-ef08-4574-9237-b3458f0519d4`
	- Directory (tenant) ID: `832b2f36-ef08-4574-9237-b3458f0519d4`
	- Object ID: `5f0bdb0c-f5f3-4596-82ae-fd2ca1719cc1`	
	- Application (client) ID: `52501bbf-4c87-464f-a96a-7eb82dbb59bf`
	- Application ID URI (audience): `api://52501bbf-4c87-464f-a96a-7eb82dbb59bf`

- Configuration caveats for WIF:

	- Use the Application ID URI as the audience in OIDC provider (`aud` claim).
	- Use the Application (client) ID as the `google.subject`, i.e., `google.subject = assertion.appid`.
	- If you will impersonate a Google service account via WIF (e.g., for Translation API access), download the client configuration from the "Connected service accounts" tab in Blackbird and use it for the connection as the configuration must have `service_account_impersonation_url` parameter in it.

## Connecting

1. Navigate to Apps, and identify the Google Translate app. You can use search to find it.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'Production'.
4. Fill in the 'Service account configuration string' field with JSON content downloaded from Google Cloud Platform.
5. Click _Connect_.

## Actions 

- **Translate text** - Translates text to a specified language. Supports glossary, adaptive datasets and custom AutoML models.
- **Translate** - Translates a document to a specified language
  - Supports glossary, adaptive datasets and custom AutoML models.
  - Works with Blackbirds interoperable actions, so HTML, XLIFF and other Blackbird's interoperable files could be passed as is.
  - Natively supported document formats by Google itself: PDF, DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, XLS, XLSX.
