Google Translate is a multilingual neural machine translation service developed by Google to translate text, documents and websites from one language into another.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have a `Service account configuration string` for your Google Cloud project. You can create a service account or use an existing one in the Google Cloud Console (IAM & Admin -> Service accounts) and generate a key for it. The key will be a JSON file that contains the service account configuration string. You should copy the content of the JSON file and paste it into the `Service account configuration string` field.

## Connecting

1.  Navigate to Apps, and identify the Google Translate app. You can use search to find it.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My Google Translate connection'.
4. Fill in the 'Service account configuration string' field.
5. Click _Connect_.
