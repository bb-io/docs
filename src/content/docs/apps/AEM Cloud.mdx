AEM Cloud (Adobe Experience Manager) is a Content Management System (CMS) that allows users and companies to easily build websites, apps, and manage web pages and content. AEM is used by developers and marketers to organize and distribute content across digital channels. This app supports both the on-premise version of AEM and the AEM as a Cloud Service version.

## Before setting up

Before connecting to AEM Cloud, ensure you have the following:

- An AEM Cloud instance running and accessible from the Blackbird platform.
- The Blackbird AEM plugin installed on your AEM instance. Distribution and installation instructions are available [here](https://github.com/bb-io/AEM) (see prerequisites 1ï¿½8). An AEM maintainer or developer should perform this installation. If you use the on-premise version, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/bb-io/AEM/blob/main-aem-on-prem/README.md).
- A technical account and a private key created for it, allowing you to obtain a certificate to connect to AEM (after installing the plugin). See the `Steps to Create Technical Account` section below for instructions.
- The base URL for your AEM environment (e.g., `https://author-xxxx-xxxxx.adobeaemcloud.com`).

## Steps to create technical account and get a certificate

1. Open [Cloud Manager](https://experience.adobe.com/cloud-manager/landing.html).
2. Select the required program.

3. Open the Developer Console for the required Author environment.

4. Switch to the `Integrations` tab and create a new technical account.

6. Use the `Download` button to obtain the raw data and store it in a file or another location for integration.

## Connecting

1. Navigate to Apps and search for **AEM**.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference (e.g., 'My AEM').
4. Fill in the following fields:
   - **Base URL**: Your AEM base URL (e.g., `https://author-xxxx-xxxxx.adobeaemcloud.com`)
   - **Integration JSON certificate**: The integration certificate in JSON format, found in the Developer Console. Example: `{ "ok": true, "integration": { "imsEndpoint": "ims-na1.adobelogin.com", ... }, "statusCode": 200 }`
5. Click _Connect_.
6. Confirm that the connection appears and the status is _Connected_.

## Identifying content to translate

Blackbird relies on a built-in AEM rules for determining which content to translate.

You can find and configure these rules in AEM under **Tools > Operations > Translation Rules**.

For more information on configuring translation rules, see the [official documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/sites/administering/reusing-content/translation/rules).

## Actions

- **Search content**: Search for content based on provided criteria.
- **Download content**: Download content as HTML. Requires a content ID. This action supports the following optional inputs:
   - **Include reference content**: If set to true, referenced content (other pages, content fragments, experience fragments, etc.) will be included in the downloaded HTML.
- **Upload content**: Upload content from HTML. Requires an HTML file and target path as input. This action supports the following inputs:
   - **Content** (mandatory): The interoperable HTML, XLIFF, or original JSON file to upload.
   - **Source language** (mandatory): The language path segment in the source content URL. Example: If your content path is `/content/my-site/en-us/page`, specify `/en-us` as the source language.
   - **Target language** (mandatory): The language path segment to replace the source language. Example: To convert from `/content/my-site/en-us/page` to `/content/my-site/fr-fr/page`, specify `/fr-fr` as the target language.
   - **Overwrite main content path** (optional): Completely replaces the source content path to which language inputs will be applied. Useful for testing and requires "Skip references" to be set to true.
   - **Skip references** (optional): If set to true, only the main (root) content item will be updated; reference content will not be updated.
   - **Ignore reference content errors** (optional): When set to true, errors that occur while updating reference content will be ignored. Errors will be visible in the action output.

## Events

- **On content created or updated**: Polling event that periodically checks for new or updated content. If any content is found, the event is triggered.
- **On tag added**: Periodically checks for new content with specified tags. If any content is found, the event is triggered.

> **Note on compatible content**: Blackbird supports all content types in the default page hierarchy: pages, content fragments, experience fragments, assets, etc. Support for 'Guides' and 'DITA' content is in development.

## Example

Here is an example of how to set up a translation workflow with the `AEM` and `DeepL` apps to automatically translate content in AEM and send it to DeepL for translation.

![AEM example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/AdobeExperienceManager/main/docs/images/aem_example.png)

Notes on how the example works:
- The `On content created or updated` event is triggered every hour and checks for new or updated content in AEM. If any content is found, the event is triggered.
- In the loop, the `Download content` action downloads the content from AEM in HTML format.
- The `Translate document` action of the `DeepL` app sends the downloaded content to DeepL for translation.
- The `Replace using regex` action of the `Blackbird Utilities` app replaces the original path with the target path in the translated content.

![Utility example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/AdobeExperienceManager/main/docs/images/utility_example.png)

- The `Upload content` action uploads the translated content back to AEM.

## Demo video

In this demo, we showcase a flexible and highly configurable alternative to a traditional AEM Connector using Blackbird.io.

With Blackbird, you can:
Automatically pull content from Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)
Orchestrate translation or transformation workflows
Push localized or modified content back into AEM
Add human checkpoints, AI enrichment, and custom routing

Unlike standard AEM connectors, Blackbird.io gives you full control over the process, with no-code configuration and enterprise-grade flexibility.
