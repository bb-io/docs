OneDrive is the Microsoft cloud service that connects you to all your files. It lets you store and protect your files, share them with others, and get to them from anywhere on all your devices.

## Connecting

1. Navigate to apps and search for Microsoft OneDrive.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My organization'.
4. Click _Authorize connection_.
5. Follow the instructions that Microsoft gives you, authorizing Blackbird.io to act on your behalf.
6. When you return to Blackbird, confirm that the connection has appeared and the status is _Connected_.

## Actions

### Storage

- **Upload file to folder** Upload file to specified folder
- **Download file** Download specified file
- **List files in folder** List files metadata in specified folder
- **List changed files** List changed files within specified amount of last hours
- **Get folder metadata** Get information about specific folder
- **Get file metadata** Get information about specific file
- **Create folder in parent folder** Create new folder in another folder
- **Delete folder** Delete specified folder
- **Delete file** Delete specified file

> When uploading a file to a folder, you can choose from the following options how to behave in case of conflict (there is already a file with the same name in the specified folder):
**Fail Uploading**: If a file with the same name exists, the upload will stop, preserving the original file.
**Replace File**: The existing file will be overwritten by the new upload, replacing its contents.
**Rename File**: The new file will be saved with a unique name, preserving both the original and the uploaded files.

## Polling events

- **On files created or updated** This polling event is triggered when files are created or updated. You can specify the folder to watch for changes and `Include subfolders` option to include changes in subfolders (by default it is set to `false`).
- **On folders created or updated** This polling event is triggered when folders are created or updated.
