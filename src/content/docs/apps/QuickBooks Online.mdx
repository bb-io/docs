QuickBooks is an accounting software package developed and marketed by Intuit. First introduced in 1992, QuickBooks products are geared mainly toward small and medium-sized businesses and offer on-premises accounting applications as well as cloud-based versions that accept business payments, manage and pay bills, and payroll functions.

## Before setting up 

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have a QuickBooks Online account
- You have an organization in QuickBooks Online and you know the organization ID

## Connecting

1. Navigate to Apps, and identify the QuickBooks Online app. You can use search to find it.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My QuickBooks Online connection'.
4. Fill in the 'API url' field, for example `https://sandbox-quickbooks.api.intuit.com` or `https://quickbooks.api.intuit.com`.
5. Fill in the 'Company ID' field with your QuickBooks Online organization ID.
6. Fill in the 'Minor version' field with the minor version of the QuickBooks Online API you want to use. For now, latest version is `70` (and it can start from `1`).

## Examples

### Synchronize QuickBooks Online invoices with Plunet invoices

This example demonstrates how to synchronize invoices from QuickBooks Online with Plunet invoices. First, we receive the text module from the Plunet invoice and check if it's an empty string. If it is empty, we create a new invoice in QuickBooks Online and set the text module to the newly created invoice ID. If it's not empty, we update the existing invoice in QuickBooks Online with the same text module.

![Example-invoices](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/QuickBooks-Online/main/image/README/Example-invoices.png)

This bird was built around the `Export invoice` and `Import invoice` actions. The Export invoice action retrieves the invoice from Plunet, while the Import invoice action creates or updates the invoice in QuickBooks Online. Under the hood, we receive data from Plunet, transform it into JSON format, send it to the QuickBooks Online app, parse it, and then create or update the invoice.

## Unsupported features
