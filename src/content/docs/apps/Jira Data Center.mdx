Jira is a widely used project management and issue tracking tool developed by Atlassian. It provides teams with a platform to plan, track, and manage tasks, projects, and software development processes, helping to streamline collaboration and improve project visibility. This Jira app primarily focuses on issues management.

### Adding custom fields

To create custom fields, follow [this guide](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/adding-custom-fields-1047552713.html). Once the custom fields you need are created, you need to:

- For the project you are interested in, select ![More](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/JiraDataCenter/main/Images/README/more_button.png) > _Project settings_.
- Select _Issue types_ from the left panel.
- Click on issue type to which you want to add created custom fields.
- Locate _Search all fields_ search bar in the right panel.
- Search for the field you are interested in and drag it to issue's fields.
- Click _Save changes_ button.

Note: this app currently supports only short text (plain text only) custom fields.

## Connecting

1. Navigate to apps and search for Jira. If you cannot find Jira then click _Add App_ in the top right corner, select Jira and add the app to your Blackbird environment.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My organization'.
4. Fill in the base URL to the Jira site you want to connect to. The base URL is of shape `https://<organization name>.atlassian.net`. You can usually copy this part of the URL when you are logged into your Jira instance.
5. Click _Authorize connection_.
6. Follow the instructions that Jira gives you, authorizing Blackbird.io to act on your behalf.
7. When you return to Blackbird, confirm that the connection has appeared and the status is _Connected_.

## Actions

Please note: sending too many parallel requests to Jira may result in request rejections. While we have added a retry policy to handle this, ultimate control lies with Jiraâ€™s servers.

- **On issue created** is triggered when an issue is created. If you want a bird to be triggered when an issue is created in specific project, fill the project parameter.
- **On issue assigned** is triggered when an issue is assigned to specific user. You can specify project parameter if you're interested in specific project.
- **On issue with specific type created** is triggered when an issue created has specific type (for example, a bug) or an existing issue was updated to have specific type. Optionally, you can specify project parameter.
- **On issue with specific priority created** is triggered when an issue created has the specified priority or an existing issue was updated to have the specified priority.

Otherwise, you can specify project parameter if you are interested in specific project's issues. You can also limit the event to trigger only on certain statusses.
- **On issues reach status** is triggered when issueÑ– reaches one of specific statuses.

## Optional inputs

We may provide two options for inputting one property to filter results:

1. **Manual**:
    - **Description**: Allows the user to manually enter value without the assistance of a dropdown list.
    - **Use Case**: This option is ideal when the user knows the exact value they want to use or when the dropdown may not be effective due to the large number of values available through the API.

2. **Dropdown selection**:
    - **Description**: Allows the user to select a value from a dropdown list.
    - **Use Case**: This option is suitable when there are fewer labels, making it convenient for users to select from a predefined list. However, this approach can be less effective if the number of labels is very large, potentially leading to timeout errors during data retrieval.

### Why do we use this approach?

This approach ensures flexibility by providing two methods for inputs, accommodating both situations where the user may need to manually enter specific values and where selecting from a predefined list is more practical. The 'manual' option is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of labels, which could otherwise lead to performance issues when retrieving values from the API.

## Example

![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/JiraDataCenter/main/Images/README/example.png)

This example bird fetches newest issues and assigns those with highest priority to a specific assignee.

![example_2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/JiraDataCenter/main/image/README/1708600402619.png)

This example shows how to create new TMS (Phrase) projects from issues.

## Missing features

In the future we can add actions for:

- Projects
- Dashboards
