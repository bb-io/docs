[LanguageDesk](https://www.milengo.com/languagedesk/) enables customers to easily track the progress of their projects from start to finish by providing a centralized overview of all translation and localization projects, their status, associated files, costs and communication history.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have a LanguageDesk account
- You have an API token. You can find this token in LanguageDesk under _settings_ -> _API & Ftp servers_.

## Connecting

1. Navigate to apps and search for LanguageDesk. If you cannot find Jira then click _Add App_ in the top right corner, select LanguageDesk and add the app to your Blackbird environment.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My organization'.
4. Fill in the base URL of your LanguageDesk instance. The base URL is of shape `https://<environment>.languagedesk.com`. You can usually copy this part of the URL when you are logged into your LanguageDesk instance.
5. Fill in your API token.
6. Click _Connect_.
