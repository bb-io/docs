Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet software that enables users to organize, analyze, and visualize data using tabular grids. It offers a range of features, including formulas, charts, and formatting options, making it a versatile tool for various data-related tasks and business applications.

## Exporting glossaries

To utilize the **Export glossary** action, ensure that the Excel worksheet mirrors the structure obtained from the **Import glossary** action result. Follow these guidelines:

- **Worksheet structure**:
   - The first row serves as column names, representing properties of the glossary entity: _ID_, _Definition_, _Subject field_, _Notes_, _Term (language code)_, _Variations (language code)_, _Notes (language code)_.
   - Include columns for each language present in the glossary. For instance, if the glossary includes English and Spanish, the column names will be: _ID_, _Definition_, _Subject field_, _Notes_, _Term (en)_, _Variations (en)_, _Notes (en)_, _Term (es)_, _Variations (es)_, _Notes (es)_.
- **Optional fields**:
    - _Definition_, _Subject field_, _Notes_, _Variations (language code)_, _Notes (language code)_ are optional and can be left empty.
- **Main term and synonyms**:
    - _Term (language code)_ represents the primary term in the specified language for the glossary.
    - _Variations (language code)_ includes synonymous values for the term.
- **Notes handing**:
    - Notes in the _Notes_ column should be separated by ';' if there are multiple notes for a given entry.
- **Variations handling**:
    - Variations in the _Variations (language code)_ column should be separated by ';' if there are multiple variations for a given term.
- **Terms notes format**:
    - Each note in the _Notes (language code)_ column should follow this structure: **Term or variation: note**.
    - Notes for terms should be separated by ';;'. For example, 'money: may refer to physical or banked currency;; cash: refers to physical currency.'
