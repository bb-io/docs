## Events

To enable webhooks, you need to:
- Have created a Service User in your Trados instance
- Have created an application based on the aforementioned Service User (this can be done by expanding the account menu on the top right-hand corner of RWS Trados Enterprise web UI, selecting Integrations > Applications.) 
- Pick up the webhook URL from your Bird, once published, in Blackbird, and use it as Webhook URL in the Webhooks section of your Trados application. You also need to choose which action(s) will trigger events to the entered URL endpoint. 
More information about how to set up your Trados webhooks can be found [here](https://languagecloud.sdl.com/lc/api-docs/webhooks-setup).
