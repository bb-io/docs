SharePoint is a platform developed by Microsoft that serves as a central hub for collaboration, document management, and content sharing within organizations. It allows users to create, store, and access documents, as well as collaborate on projects in a secure and organized online environment.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have a Microsoft 365 account.
- You have a [SharePoint site created](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/create-a-site-in-sharepoint-4d1e11bf-8ddc-499d-b889-2b48d10b1ce8).

### How to find site URL

You can find the site URL on SharePoint site main page.
![Main page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/MicrosoftSharePoint/main/image/README/my-site-Url.png)

Copy the site URL.

## Connecting

1. Navigate to apps and search for Microsoft SharePoint.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My organization'.
4. Fill in the URL of your site e.g. 'https://MyCommunicationSite.sharepoint.com/sites/Testwebsite'. 
5. Click _Authorize connection_.
6. Follow the instructions that Microsoft gives you, authorizing Blackbird.io to act on your behalf.
7. When you return to Blackbird, confirm that the connection has appeared and the status is _Connected_.

Note: if you have just created a site, you should wait a couple of minutes before trying to connect.

## Example
Example 1
![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/MicrosoftSharePoint/main/image/README/example.png)

Here, whenever PDF files are uploaded to SharePoint Documents, each file is downloaded, translated with Language Weaver and placed in the appropriate directory based on the translation quality assessment.

Example 2
![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/MicrosoftSharePoint/main/image/README/example2.png)
In this example, the workflow starts with the **On pages created or updated**. Then, the workflow uses the **Get page as HTML** action to get html content of updated/created page. In the next step we translate this content via DeepL and then send the translated page to Slack channel.
