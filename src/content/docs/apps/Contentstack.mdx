## Connecting

1. Navigate to apps and search for Contentstack.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My contentstack connection'.
4. In the _Host region_ field, select your Contentstack region.
5. Fill in the _Stack API key_ and  _Management token_
6. Click _Connect_.

## HTML features

We add metadata to the HTML file to include `Entry ID` and `Content Type ID`. This metadata is used to update the entry content from the HTML file. These tags are used to identify the content in the `Contentstack`, eliminating the need to store IDs elsewhere.

Here is an example of how we include metadata in the HTML file:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <meta name="blackbird-content-type-id" content="your-content-type">
        <meta name="blackbird-entry-id" content="your-entry-id">
    </head>
    <body>
        <div path="title">Example HTML page</div>
        <div path="description">Blackbird is the new automation backbone for the language technology industry.</div>
    </body>
</html>
```
