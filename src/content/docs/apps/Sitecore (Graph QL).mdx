Sitecore is one of the leading enterprise-level content management systems, enabling web content editors and marketers to have full control over all aspects of their websites — from social integration and blogs to personalization and ecommerce.

This application focuses on integrating Sitecore content, languages, and workflows into the **Blackbird automation environment** using **Sitecore GraphQL API**.

Unlike the previous generation, which required a custom plugin installation on your Sitecore instance, this app uses the **publicly available Sitecore GraphQL endpoint**, simplifying setup and maintenance.

For the legacy plugin-based version of this integration, see [Blackbird.io Sitecore XM Cloud (Plugin)](https://docs.blackbird.io/apps/sitecore-xm-cloud/).

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

### For Sitecore XM Cloud

- You have a **Sitecore XM Cloud** instance.
- You have a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** available from your XM Cloud credentials.
- You know your **Sitecore base URL** (e.g., `https://xmc-yourorg-yourinstance.sitecorecloud.io`).

### For Sitecore XP

- You are using **Sitecore XP version 10.3 or higher**.
- The **GraphQL API** feature is enabled for your Sitecore instance.
- **Sitecore Identity Server** is configured and accessible.
- You have a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** configured in your Sitecore Identity Server for OAuth2 authentication with `client_credentials` grant type.
- You know your **Sitecore CM base URL** (e.g., `https://cm.yourdomain.com`).
- You know your **Identity Server URL** (e.g., `https://identity.yourdomain.com`).

## Enabling GraphQL API

This application interacts directly with your Sitecore instance via the built-in **GraphQL API**.

### For Sitecore XP

To enable and configure the GraphQL endpoint and Identity Server authentication in your Sitecore XP environment, follow the official Sitecore guide:

➡️ [Walkthrough: Enabling and authorizing requests to the Authoring and Management API](https://doc.sitecore.com/xp/en/developers/latest/sitecore-experience-manager/walkthrough--enabling-and-authorizing-requests-to-the-authoring-and-management-api.html)

To verify that the GraphQL API is configured properly, you can navigate to: `https://your-cm-instance.com/sitecore/api/authoring/graphql/ide/`

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the GraphQL interface.

### For Sitecore XM Cloud

Sitecore XM Cloud comes with GraphQL API enabled by default. No additional configuration is required.

## Actions

### Content (items)

- **Search content**  
  Retrieve a list of Sitecore content items with pagination and language filtering.

- **Get content information**  
  Retrieve detailed information for a specific content item by its ID.

- **Download content**  
  Download the full content of a Sitecore item as an HTML file.  
  This allows further processing, translation, or storage in localization systems.
  It's possible to inlude child items into file as well by enabling `Include child items` option. Also, using filtering options you can specify which fields should be included in the downloaded HTML.

- **Upload content**  
  Upload translated or modified content back into Sitecore.  
  Supports both **HTML** and **XLIFF 2.0/2.1/2.2** formats.  
  If the specified version or language doesn’t exist, a new version is automatically created.

- **Delete content**  
  Permanently delete a Sitecore content item by its ID.

### Workflows

- **Search workflows**  
  Retrieve all configured workflows along with their states.  
  This includes workflow IDs, display names, and available transitions.

- **Update workflow state**  
  Change the workflow state of a specific content item.  
  Useful for automation scenarios such as moving items from “Ready for translation” to “In translation” or “Translation completed”.

## Events

### On content created or updated

A polling event that periodically checks for new or updated content items.  
When new or updated items are detected, they are returned as part of the event payload.

> **Important:**
> - Events are **polling-based**, not real-time.
> - Default polling interval: **5 minutes**.
> - You can configure the polling frequency in the UI.
