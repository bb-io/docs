## Events

- **On customer created** Triggered when a new XTRF customer is created
- **On customer updated** Triggered when a new XTRF customer is updated
- **On job status changed** Triggered when the status of an XTRF job is changed
- **On project created** Triggered when a new XTRF project is created
- **On project status changed** Triggered when the status of an XTRF project is changed
- **On quote created** Triggered when a new XTRF quote is created

## Using filter strings in events

**On project status changed**, **On quote status changed** and **On customer updated** events have an optional parameter called _Filter string_, enabling result filtering based on custom fields. Please note the following:

- Currently, only text and single selection custom fields are supported for filtering. Complex filtering (such as AND, OR, NOT etc.) is not supported.
- Custom fields should be referenced by their keys with ".,()' characters and spaces changed to underscores. For instance, to reference _My text field_ you should use _customFields.My_text_field_.

For example, to trigger a bird on project status changes with the custom field _My text field_ set to _Some value_, select the **On project status changed** event in the bird editor. Then, choose the optional input _Filter string_ and enter _customFields.My_text_field=Some value_:

## Receivable and payable for project

Our app allows you to import CAT files into XTRF using specific actions such as **Create receivable for project** and **Create payable for project** for both smart and classic projects. This feature enables you to seamlessly integrate CAT tools with XTRF, streamlining your translation workflow.

With this functionality, you can easily transfer CAT files between the Phrase and XTRF apps, ensuring smooth collaboration and efficient project management.

Here's an example to demonstrate how this feature works:
