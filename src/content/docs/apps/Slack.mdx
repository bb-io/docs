Slack is a messaging app for businesses that improves communication, teamwork, and decision-making. It allows people to collaborate easily, work on their own time, and share information in dedicated chat spaces.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that you have a Slack account and you are part of a specific workspace. You need to be an Slack admin or have permission to connect external applications to your Slack channel. You can also [invite your Slack admin to Blackbird](https://docs.blackbird.io/concepts/nests/#users) in order for them to authorize the connection. 

### Enable webhooks

If you want to use Slack webhooks, you'll need to add Blackbird bot to the channels you're interested in after you've created a connection. There are two ways to do this.

The first way:

- Select a channel.
- Send a message with _@Blackbird_ content.
- Click _Add to channel_.
- Do the same for other channels you're interested in.

The second way:

- Go to the channel you selected during connection creation.
- Find _added an integration to this channel: Blackbird_ message.
- Click on _Blackbird_ -> _Add this app to a channel..._ -> select a channel from dropdown.
- Do the same for other channels you're interested in.

## Connecting

1. Navigate to Apps, and identify the **Slack** app. You can use search to find it.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My organization'.
4. Click _Authorize connection_.
5. Follow the instructions that Slack gives you, allowing Blackbird to access the selected workspace.
6. When you return to Blackbird, confirm that the connection has appeared and the status is _Connected_.

## Actions

### Messages

- **Send message** sends a message to a Slack channel. Add a text message, attachments or both. Optionally send the message in a thread. You can customize the username that appears in Slack when the bot sends a message. If this is not set, the bot's default username will be used. Send as user optional input allows you to send a message on behalf of another user instead of the bot. The message will appear as if it was sent by the selected user, with their profile photo beside it. Also, if you specify attachments the `Timestamp` output will be empty, because Slack does not return a timestamp for messages with [attachments](https://api.slack.com/methods/files.completeUploadExternal#facts);
- **Get message** returns message information, including attachments if it has any
- **Delete message**
- **Send scheduled message**
- **Update message**

### Reactions

- **Add reaction** adds a reaction to a message.
- **Remove reaction** removes a reaction from a message. Note: The Slack bot can only remove reactions it has added.
- **Get reactions** lists all reactions for a single message.

### Channels

- **Create channel**

### Users

- **Get all users** retrieves a list of users in a Slack team.
- **Get user information**.
- **Get user by email**.
- **Get user profile**.
- **Get team**.

## Events

- **On message** is triggered when any new message is sent to a channel. This event has a parameter _Trigger on message replies_ which is _False_ by default. If you want your bird to trigger on channel messages and message replies, set this parameter to _True_. If you use **On channel message** with **Send message in thread** in a single flow, you should set _Trigger on message replies_ to _False_ or leave it unspecified to avoid an infinite loop. If you want your bird to trigger only when a message has file attachments, set the _Trigger only when message has files_ to _True_, default is _False_.
- **On app mentioned** is triggered when the app is mentioned (@Blackbird). Useful to create workflow triggers that only start when specifically invoked by a user through Slack.
- **On member joined channel**.
- **On reaction added**. Can be configured to a specific channel and a specific emoji.

## Example

![Example-2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/Slack/main/image/README/example-2.png)

Here, whenever a new message with attachments is sent, we receive files by `Get message` action, iterate over them and send them to **Google Drive** using `Upload file` action.
