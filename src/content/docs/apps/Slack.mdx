### Enable webhooks

If you want to use Slack webhooks, you'll need to add Blackbird bot to the channels you're interested in after you've created a connection. There are two ways to do this. 

The first way:

- Select a channel.
- Send a message with _@Blackbird_ content.
- Click _Add to channel_.
- Do the same for other channels you're interested in.

The second way:

- Go to the channel you selected during connection creation.
- Find _added an integration to this channel: Blackbird_ message.
- Click on _Blackbird_ -> _Add this app to a channel..._ -> select a channel from dropdown.
- Do the same for other channels you're interested in.
