3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My WordsOnline connection'.

## Actions

- **Create request**: Create a new translation request based on the provided parameters. Auto approving the request is optional, but by default it is set to `true`. Under the hood we receive files, then we zip them and send them to WordsOnline.
- **Download files**: Downloads the files from the request. By default, it will download all files (in all zip files). But you can specify zip which contains the files you want to download.
