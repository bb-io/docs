Pinecone is a cloud-native vector database designed for high-performance AI applications, offering a managed solution with no infrastructure complexities. It specializes in storing and quickly querying vector embeddings, which serve as long-term memory for applications involving large language models, generative AI, and semantic search. The system ensures fast and accurate queries at scale, with low-latency results reflecting real-time updates and offering customization options for enhanced performance.
