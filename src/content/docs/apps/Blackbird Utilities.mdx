The Utilities provide generic utility Actions and Events that can come in useful in any Bird. It includes Utilities for text, dates, files, Actions for specific file formats, and you can even use it to scrape web pages.
You do not need to create a connection to use Utilities. Instead, you can find Utilities at the top level menu when adding a new item in your Bird.
