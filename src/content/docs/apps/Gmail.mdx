Gmail is the email service provided by Google. Gmail offers a suite of tools and functions which make it easy to create a system that will keep your inbox organized, save you time, and free you up to focus on important business tasks.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have a **Gmail** account and you have the credentials to access it.

## Connecting

1. Navigate to Apps, and identify the **Gmail** app. You can use search to find it.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My Gmail connection'.
4. Click _Authorize connection_.
5. Establish the Gmail connection via OAuth.

## Actions

- **Search emails** Returns a list of IDs which can be used in conjunction with 'Get email'. Add an optional query to narrow your search. Supports the same query format as the Gmail search box. For example, "from:someuser@example.com is:unread".
- **Get email** Returns email metadata, message and all attachments.
- **Send email** Sends an email, including attachments.
- **Trash email** Moves an email to the trash folder.

## Events

- **On emails received** Triggered when new emails are received. You can optionally set a query to refine the search. The same query logic as 'Search emails' is used. *Note*: this is a polling trigger, therefore you have to set a polling interval and you will receive multiple email IDs. Use "Get email" to get information about each email.

## Examples

Here is an example of a simple Gmail workflow:

![1725608752440](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/Gmail/main/image/README/1725608752440.png)

In this example, the workflow starts when a new batch of emails is polled. All the emails are looped through, the information and attachments for each email are fetched and they are then forwarded to Slack.

A more complicated example is shown here:

![1725609061387](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/Gmail/main/image/README/1725609061387.png)

In this workflow, we create a new Plunet quote for every email we receive (of course we can filter the received emails by certain criteria). All attachments are automatically added to the quote. We then send a confirmation email back to the sender.
