Jira is a widely used project management and issue tracking tool developed by Atlassian. It provides teams with a platform to plan, track, and manage tasks, projects, and software development processes, helping to streamline collaboration and improve project visibility. This Jira app primarily focuses on issues management.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have an Atlassian account and [Jira site](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-work-management/docs/set-up-your-site/).
- You have a [project created](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/create-a-new-project/).
- You have the right [permissions](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/permissions-for-company-managed-projects/#Issue-permissions).

## Connecting

1. Navigate to apps and search for Jira. If you cannot find Jira then click _Add App_ in the top right corner, select Jira and add the app to your Blackbird environment.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My organization'.
4. Fill in the base URL to the Jira site you want to connect to. The base URL is of shape `https://<organization name>.atlassian.net`. You can usually copy this part of the URL when you are logged into your Jira instance.
5. Click _Authorize connection_.
6. Follow the instructions that Jira gives you, authorizing Blackbird.io to act on your behalf.
7. When you return to Blackbird, confirm that the connection has appeared and the status is _Connected_.
