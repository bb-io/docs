Amazon Textract is a machine learning service that automatically extracts text, handwriting, and data from scanned documents, including forms and tables. It goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) by identifying the structure of documents, enabling the extraction of complex data fields and their relationships, which is useful for automating document processing and data entry tasks.
