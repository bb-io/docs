## Actions

### Landing & site pages

Note: the actions for landing and site pages are the same, but have separate actions for each.

A site page is a more general and versatile page on Hubspot CMS website that can contain various types of content and is part of your site's overall navigation and structure. A landing page in HubSpot CMS is a standalone page typically designed for a specific marketing campaign, with a clear call-to-action (CTA) to capture leads.

- **Get a landing/site page** Retrieve information from a specific page on your website by selecting it from a dynamic drop-down list as an input value.
- **Search landing/site pages** searches for landing/site pages matching certain criteria. One of those criteria is _Not translated in language_ which you can use to filter pages that are missing translations.
- **Get a landing/site page as HTML file** Get webpage details and an HTML file of its content for easy translation and integration while preserving formatting and layout.
- **Translate a landing/site page from HTML file** Create a new translation for a landing/site page based on an HTML file input. It enables seamless integration of externally translated content back into the website while maintaining the HTML structure. Note: if you are using this action with a landing/site page that has no translations yet, you need to provide the primary language.
- **Schedule a landing/site page for publishing** Automate webpage publishing to release translated content at the right time for a better user experience.

### Blog posts

- **Search blog posts** searches for blog posts matching certain criteria. One of those criteria is _Not translated in language_ which you can use to filter pages that are missing translations.
- **Get blog post** Get blog post information.
- **Create blog post** Create a new blog post. This action allows for the generation of fresh, localized content to engage global audiences and expand the reach of your blog or website, fostering international growth and user engagement.
- **Delete blog post** Delete a blog post
- **Get blog post as HTML file** Get blog post as HTML file.
- **Translate blog post from HTML file** Translate blog post from HTML file.
- **Update blog post** Update a blog post information.
- **Schedule a blog post page for publishing** Automate blog post publishing to release translated content at the right time for a better user experience.

### Marketing emails

Note: the Hubspot API marks these endpoints in beta stage.

- **Search marketing emails** searches for marketing emails based on certain criteria.
- **Create marketing email** creates a new marketing email.
- **Get marketing email content as HTML** returns a marketing email as an HTML file for convenient translation.
- **Update marketing email content from HTML** updates a marketing email content from a (translated) HTML file.

## Events

- **On blog posts created or updated** triggers when a blog post is created or updated.
- **On landing pages created or updated** triggers when a landing page is created or updated.
- **On site pages created or updated** triggers when a site page is created or updated.

This events are working on polling mechanism, so you won't be immediately notified about the changes. You can configure the polling interval starting from 5 minutes to 7 days.

## Useful tips

All actions that work with HTML files will add a meta tag to the HTML. This meta tag is named `blackbird-reference-id`. This tag is used to identify the content in the Hubspot CMS, eliminating the need to store IDs elsewhere

## Examples

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/Hubspot/main/image/README/Event-example.png)

This example uses a polling event to check for new blog posts. When a new blog post is created, the event triggers and the blog post is translated into a different language.
