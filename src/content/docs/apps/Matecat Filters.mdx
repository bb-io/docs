Easily extract all the translatable contents from any file format into a convenient XLIFF file. Translate it and use Filters again to get back a completely translated file with perfectly preserved formatting.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have a RapidAPI key for the Matecat filters API. You can get a key [here](https://rapidapi.com/translated/api/matecat-filters/pricing).

## Connecting

1. Navigate to apps and search for Matecat filters.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My Matecat filters'.
4. Enter your Matecat Filters [API key](https://rapidapi.com/translated/api/matecat-filters).
5. Click _Connect_.

## Actions

- **Convert to XLIFF** Take any file format [supported by Matecat Filters](https://filters.matecat.com/formats.html) and convert it to an XLIFF.
  - For JSON files you can specify optional input parameter "Do not translate keys" which allows you to ignore specific JSON keys for translation
- **Convert XLIFF to source file** Convert a translated XLIFF back to its original file format.
- **Convert XLIFF to target file** Convert a translated XLIFF to a translated file.
