Notion is a note-taking and idea-organizing platform. This Notion application primarily centers around page and database management.  
  
 ## Before setting up
 Before you can connect you need to make sure that:
 - You have a Notion account
 - You have sufficient permissions in the workspace you want to connect Blackbird with.
 
## Connecting  
  
1. Navigate to apps and search for Notion. 
2. Click _Add Connection_.  
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My Notion connection'.  
4. Click _Authorize connection_.
5. In the popup, select the workspace you want to connect to in the top right corner.
6. Click _Select pages_
7. Manually select all the pages you want Blackbird to access.
8. Click _Allow access_
9. Confirm that the connection has appeared and the status is _Connected_.  
  
> If you later want to give Blackbird the ability to access other pages, you can do so manually through the page options in Notion.

## Actions  
  
### Blocks  
  
- **List block's children** returns all children of a specified block. Instead of block you can input ID of a `Page`, so that it will return all blocks belonging the that page.  
- **Get/Delete block** 

### Comments

- **List comments** returns a list of comments added to the specified `Block`.
- **Add comment** adds comment to a specified `Page` or `Discussion`.

### Databases

- **List databases** returns a list of all databases in the workspace. You can filter the list by create/edited time.
- **List database records** returns a list of all child `Pages` in the database. You can filter the list by create/edited time. 
- **Create/Get database**

### Pages

- **List pages** returns a list of all pages in the workspace. You can filter the list by create/edited time.
- **Get page as HTML** returns specified page's content as an HTML file.
- **Create/Update page from HTML** creates/updates a page from an HTML file. We recommend using the 'Create page from HTML' action, as it doesn't affect existing content. On the other hand, the 'Update page from HTML' action does affect existing content. Since Notion doesn't allow updating blocks directly, it will first delete all the content of the page and then add it from the HTML file.
- **Get page string/number/date/boolean/files/multiple property** returns the value of a database entry's property of specific type.
- **Set page string/number/boolean/files/multiple property** updates the value of a database entry's property of specific type.
- **Set page property as empty**
- **Create/Get/Archive page**

> For the 'Create page' and 'Create page from HTML' actions, you must specify the parent page or database where the new page will be created. If not specified, the action will fail with an error.

### Users

- **List users** returns a list of users belonging to the workspace.
- **Get users** returns details about specified user.

## Events

### Pages

- **On pages created** triggers when new pages are created. To allow Blackbird access to the newly created pages you should do so manually through the page options in Notion
- **On pages updated** triggers when any pages are updated.
- **On button clicked** triggers when a user clicks on a button in Notion. See setup instructions below.

## Triggering on button clicked

1. Create a Bird that starts with the event *On button clicked*
2. Configure the Bird and publish it.

3. Copy the Webhook URL at the bottom of the event panel.
4. Create a button in Notion. You can do this either inside page content or as a page property.

7. Test the button by clicking on the button!

## HTML Conversion

Blackbird can convert `Page` content to an HTML file and back, enabling automatic translation of Notion content via Blackbird. For example, you can set up a workflow like this: "Notion: Get page as HTML" → "DeepL: Translate" → "Notion: Update page from HTML."

Untranslatable content will also be transferred, with a few exceptions. These include:

- **Link preview**
- **Notion-hosted files** (such as PDFs, audio, video, or images; however, external URLs will work fine)

For now, these types won't be transferred. We are continuously working to improve this process.

> Translating child pages and child databases is fully supported. You can translate child pages and/or child databases by setting the 'Include child pages' and 'Include child databases' optional inputs to true for the 'Get page as HTML' action. If these inputs are not set or are set to false, we will not extract or translate child pages/databases, and the new (or updated) page will not include these child pages/databases.
