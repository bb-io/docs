Notion is a note-taking and idea-organizing platform. This Notion application primarily centers around page and database management.  
  
 ## Before setting up
 Before you can connect you need to make sure that:
 - You have a Notion account
 - You have sufficient permissions in the workspace you want to connect Blackbird with.
 
## Connecting  
  
1. Navigate to apps and search for Notion. 
2. Click _Add Connection_.  
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My Notion connection'.  
4. Click _Authorize connection_.
5. In the popup, select the workspace you want to connect to in the top right corner.
6. Click _Select pages_
7. Manually select all the pages you want Blackbird to access.
8. Click _Allow access_
9. Confirm that the connection has appeared and the status is _Connected_.  
  
> If you later want to give Blackbird the ability to access other pages, you can do so manually through the page options in Notion.

## Actions  
  
### Blocks  
  
- **List block's children** returns all children of a specified block. Instead of block you can input ID of a `Page`, so that it will return all blocks belonging the that page.  
- **Get/Delete block** 

### Comments

- **List comments** returns a list of comments added to the specified `Block`.
- **Add comment** adds comment to a specified `Page` or `Discussion`.

### Databases

- **List databases** returns a list of all databases in the workspace. You can filter the list by create/edited time.
- **List database records** returns a list of all child `Pages` in the database. You can filter the list by create/edited time. 
- **Create/Get database**

### Pages

- **List pages** returns a list of all pages in the workspace. You can filter the list by create/edited time.
- **Get page as HTML** returns specified page's content as an HTML file.
- **Create/Update page from HTML** create/updates page from an HTML file.
- **Get page string/number/date/boolean/files/multiple property** returns the value of a database entry's property of specific type.
- **Set page string/number/boolean/files/multiple property** updates the value of a database entry's property of specific type.
- **Create/Get/Archive page**

### Users

- **List users** returns a list of users belonging to the workspace.
- **Get users** returns details about specified user.

## HTML Conversion

Blackbird is able to convert `Page` content to an HTML file and back, so that it is possible to translate Notion content automatically via Blackbird.  For example, you can do a combination like "Notion: Get page as HTML" -> "DeepL: Translate" -> "Notion: Update page from HTML". Untranslatable content will be transferred back as well, except of several types like: Reference, Image, File, Link. These types won't be transferred for now, but we are constantly working to make it better.
