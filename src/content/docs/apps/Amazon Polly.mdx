Amazon Polly is a text-to-speech service that uses advanced deep learning technologies to convert written text into natural-sounding human speech. It supports multiple languages and voices, allowing developers to create applications that can talk and enhance user engagement through lifelike speech synthesis. Polly is commonly used for creating voice-enabled applications, automated customer service, and content accessibility.
