Jira is a widely used project management and issue tracking tool developed by Atlassian. It provides teams with a platform to plan, track, and manage tasks, projects, and software development processes, helping to streamline collaboration and improve project visibility. This Jira app primarily focuses on issues management.

- You have an Atlassian account and [Jira site](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-work-management/docs/set-up-your-site/).
- You have a [project created](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/create-a-new-project/).
- You have the right [permissions](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/permissions-for-company-managed-projects/#Issue-permissions).

### Enable webhooks

If you want to use Jira webhooks, you need to:

- Log in as a user with Administer Jira [global permission](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-global-permissions/).

### Adding custom fields

To create custom fields, follow [this guide](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/adding-custom-fields-1047552713.html). Once the custom fields you need are created, you need to:

- Choose ![Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/Jira/main/Images/README/settings.png) > _Projects_ in top right corner.
- For the project you are interested in, select ![More](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/Jira/main/Images/README/more_button.png) > _Project settings_.
- Select _Issue types_ from the left panel.
- Click on issue type to which you want to add created custom fields.
- Locate _Search all fields_ search bar in the right panel.
- Search for the field you are interested in and drag it to issue's fields.
- Click _Save changes_ button.

Note: this app currently supports only short text (plain text only) custom fields.

## Connecting

1. Navigate to apps and search for Jira. If you cannot find Jira then click _Add App_ in the top right corner, select Jira and add the app to your Blackbird environment.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My organization'.
