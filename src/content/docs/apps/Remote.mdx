**Remote** is a Global HR Platform that helps companies hire, manage, and pay their entire team — and more effectively compete in the modern global economy through our comprehensive set of core solutions including, HRIS, payroll, international employment, contractor management, and more.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have a Remote instance
- You have a Remote API token. You can find a detailed guide on how to get it [here](https://remote.com/resources/api/auth-and-authorization).

## Connecting

1. Navigate to Apps, and identify the **Remote** app. You can use search to find it.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My Remote connection'.
4. Fill in the `Base URL` field. If you are using production environment, you should use `https://gateway.remote.com`. If you are using sandbox environment, you should use `https://gateway.remote-sandbox.com`.
5. Fill in the `API token` you got from Remote.
6. Click **Connect**.
7. Make sure that connection was added successfully.

- **Create time off** creates a new time off for the employee.
