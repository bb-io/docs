2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My Remote connection'.
4. Fill in the `Base URL` field. If you are using production environment, you should use `https://gateway.remote.com`. If you are using sandbox environment, you should use `https://gateway.remote-sandbox.com`.

Steps:

1. Country code: Specify the country code for the employee. This is crucial because each country may require different contract details.

3. Contract details values (Optional Input): Alongside the keys, you must specify the values corresponding to each key. The order of keys and values must match exactly, as they will be merged into an object in the code.
