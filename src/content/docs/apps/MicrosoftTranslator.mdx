This application build around the Azure AI Translator API. Azure AI Translator is a cloud-based neural machine translation service that can be used with any operating system. It powers many Microsoft products and services for language translation and other language-related operations. The service uses modern neural machine translation technology and offers statistical machine translation technology.

## Before setting up

Before setting up the connection you must be known with the following:

- In order to get `Document translation endpoint` you can find documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/translator/document-translation/how-to-guides/use-rest-api-programmatically?tabs=csharp#retrieve-your-key-and-custom-domain-endpoint). Note, that Document Translation is supported in the S1 Standard Service Plan (Pay-as-you-go) and C2, C3, C4, and D3 Volume Discount Plans. See [Azure AI services pricingâ€”Translator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/translator/)
- You can find how to get `API key` [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/translator/document-translation/how-to-guides/use-rest-api-programmatically?tabs=csharp#prerequisites)
- If you are unsure about your region you can try `global` as a default value. You can find more information [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/translator/document-translation/how-to-guides/create-use-managed-identities)

## Actions

- **Translate** - Translates the text to the target language. 
- **Translate document** - Translates the document to the target language, under the hood we are using synchronous translation. The action returns the translated document. You can find supported file formats [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/translator/document-translation/overview#batch-supported-document-formats).
- **Transliterate** - Transliterates the text to the target script.

## Example 

Here is an example of how you can use the Microsoft Translator app in a workflow. In this example, we are translating a document from Google Drive to the target language and then sending the translated document back to a different folder.
