This application build around the Azure AI Translator API. Azure AI Translator is a cloud-based neural machine translation service that can be used with any operating system. It powers many Microsoft products and services for language translation and other language-related operations. The service uses modern neural machine translation technology and offers statistical machine translation technology.

## Before setting up

Before setting up the connection you must be known with the following:

- In order to get `Document translation endpoint` you can find documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/translator/document-translation/how-to-guides/use-rest-api-programmatically?tabs=csharp#retrieve-your-key-and-custom-domain-endpoint). Note, that Document Translation is supported in the S1 Standard Service Plan (Pay-as-you-go) and C2, C3, C4, and D3 Volume Discount Plans. See [Azure AI services pricing—Translator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/translator/)
- You can find how to get `API key` [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/translator/document-translation/how-to-guides/use-rest-api-programmatically?tabs=csharp#prerequisites)
- If you are unsure about your region you can try `global` as a default value. You can find more information [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/translator/document-translation/how-to-guides/create-use-managed-identities)

## Connecting

1. Navigate to Apps, and identify the **Microsoft Translator** app. You can use search to find it.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My organization'.
4. Fill all the required fields:
   - `Document translation endpoint` - The endpoint for the document translation service. We expect something like this: https://[NAME-OF-YOUR-RESOURCE].cognitiveservices.azure.com.
   - `API key` - The API key for the document translation service.
   - `Region` - The region where the document translation service is hosted.
5. Click _Connect_.
6. Confirm that the connection has appeared and the status is _Connected_.

## Actions

### **Translate**
Translates the text to the target language. This action supports the following input parameters:

- **Text**: The text to be translated.
- **Target language**: The language to which the text will be translated.
- **Source language**: The language of the input text. If not specified, automatic language detection is applied.
- **Text type**: Defines whether the text being translated is plain text or HTML. Possible values are: `plain` or `html`.
- **Category**: Specifies the category (domain) of the translation, used to get translations from a customized system.
- **Profanity action**: Specifies how profanities should be treated in translations. Possible values are: `NoAction`, `Marked`, or `Deleted`.
- **Profanity marker**: Specifies how profanities should be marked in translations. Possible values are: `Asterisk` or `Tag`.
- **Include alignment**: Specifies whether to include alignment projection from source text to translated text. Possible values are: `true` or `false`.
- **Include sentence length**: Specifies whether to include sentence boundaries for the input text and the translated text. Possible values are: `true` or `false`.
- **Suggested from**: A fallback language if the language of the input text can't be identified.
- **From script**: The script of the input text.
- **To script**: The script of the translated text.
- **Allow fallback**: Specifies that the service is allowed to fall back to a general system when a custom system doesn't exist. Possible values are: `true` or `false`. Allow fallback = false specifies that the translation should only use systems trained for the category specified by the request. If a translation from language X to language Y requires chaining through a pivot language E, then all the systems in the chain (X → E and E → Y) need to be custom and have the same category. If no system is found with the specific category, the request returns a 400 status code. Allow fallback = true specifies that the service is allowed to fall back to a general system when a custom system doesn't exist.

As this [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/translator/custom-translator/how-to/translate-with-custom-model) mentions, if you want to translate text with a custom model, you should specify the `category` optional input and provide the ID of your custom category in this field.
Example of a category ID: `a2eb72f9-43a8-46bd-82fa-4693c8b64c3c-TECH`

### **Translate document**
Translates the document to the target language, using synchronous translation under the hood. The action returns the translated document. This action supports the following input parameters:

- **File**: The document file to be translated.
- **Target language**: The language to which the document will be translated.
- **Source language**: The language of the input document. If not specified, automatic language detection is applied.
- **Category**: Specifies the category (domain) of the translation, used to get translations from a customized system.
- **Allow fallback**: Specifies that the service is allowed to fall back to a general system when a custom system doesn't exist. Possible values are: `true` or `false`.  Allow fallback = false specifies that the translation should only use systems trained for the category specified by the request. If a translation from language X to language Y requires chaining through a pivot language E, then all the systems in the chain (X → E and E → Y) need to be custom and have the same category. If no system is found with the specific category, the request returns a 400 status code. Allow fallback = true specifies that the service is allowed to fall back to a general system when a custom system doesn't exist.

Supported file formats can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/translator/document-translation/overview#batch-supported-document-formats).

### **Transliterate**
Transliterates the text to the target script. This action supports the following input parameters:

- **Text**: The text to be transliterated.
- **Source language**: The language of the input text.
- **Source script**: Specifies the script used by the input text.
- **Target script**: Specifies the script to which the text will be transliterated.

## Example 

Here is an example of how you can use the Microsoft Translator app in a workflow. In this example, we are translating a document from Google Drive to the target language and then sending the translated document back to a different folder.
