XTM Cloud is a translation management system. Features include the creation of projects and uploading files to these projects in order to translate them.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have an XTM Cloud instance with **API access enabled**.

## Connecting

1. Navigate to apps and search for XTM. If you cannot find XTM then click _Add App_ in the top right corner, select XTM and add the app to your Blackbird environment.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My XTM'.
4. For client fill in your XTM Company name, also marked client in the [XTM documentation](https://api.xtm-cloud.com/rest-api/#tag/XTM-Basic/operation/generateToken).
5. For User ID fill in your numeric XTM user ID. Note: **This is not your username**. A known way to retrieve this user ID is to log into your XTM portal, hover on your avatar in the top right corner and right click "open image in new tab". Then in the URL of this page you will find your user ID.\*
6. Fill in your XTM user password.
7. Finally fill in the base URL of your XTM instance. F.e. `https://xtm.mycompany.com`
8. Click _Connect_.

\* Do you know a better way to retrieve the User ID? Let us know!

### Files

- **Download source files**

- **Generate files**

### Translation memories

- **Generate TM file**
- **Download TM file**

### Customers

- **List customers**
- **Create customer**
- **Get customer**
- **Update customer**
- **Delete customer**

## Events

>Note: XTM uses callback URLs that can only be set at the time of project creation, this means that only projects that have been created through Blackbird will work with non-polling Events. To trigger Birds based on Events regarding projects that were not created via Blackbird, use a [polling trigger](../concepts/triggers/#polling) - identified below as **polling**.

- **On analysis finished**
- **On workflow transition**
- **On job finished**
- **On project created**
- **On project accepted**
- **On project finished**
- **On invoice status changed**
- **On analysis finished (polling)**
- **On projects created (polling)**
- **On projects updated (polling)**
- **On projects finished (polling)**
- **On project status changed (polling)**

## Missing features

The current implementation covers the basic actions. However, in the future we can also support:

- Project analytics
- Custom fields
- Jobs
- External users
