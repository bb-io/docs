Fast, open-source and secure language models. Facilitated specialisation of models on business use-cases, leveraging private data and usage feedback.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You must [have access to the Mistral AI console](https://console.mistral.ai/).
- Create your [API key](https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys/).
- Save this key for future use.

You can view a [complete guide](https://docs.mindmac.app/how-to.../add-api-key/create-mistral-ai-api-key) about creating the Mistral AI API Key with the registration process.

## Connecting 

1. Navigate to apps and search for Mistral. If you cannot find Mistral, then click _Add App_ in the top right corner, select Contentstack, and add the app to your Blackbird environment.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference, e.g., 'My client'.
4. In the _API Key_ field, input your API Key. You can get it from [here](https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys/).
5. Click _Connect_.
6. Confirm that the connection has appeared and the status is _Connected_.

## Actions

### Chat

- **Send prompt**: This action allows you to send a prompt to an AI model and receive its response. When you submit your message, it's processed and sent to the AI through our system. The AI then generates a response based on your input. If you've had a conversation history, it will be preserved and included along with the new AI response in the returned details

## Example

Using our application you can build the following bird:

![MistralAIExample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/MistralAI/main/image/README/MistralAIExample.png)

First action:

![MistralAIExample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/MistralAI/main/image/README/MistralAIExample-1-action.png)

Second action:

![MistralAIExample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/MistralAI/main/image/README/MistralAIExample-2-action.png)

Third action:

![MistralAIExample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/MistralAI/main/image/README/MistralAIExample-3-action.png)

As you can see, you can specify a message history to maintain the context of the conversation
