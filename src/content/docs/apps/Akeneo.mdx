Akeneoâ€™s PIM (Product Information Management) solution is designed to ingest, normalize, enrich, and centralize product information. It provides enterprise-grade data modeling, governance, and workflows to ensure consistent and high-quality product data management across various channels.

## Before settings up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have an active Akeneo instance and you have sufficient rights to add apps to it.
- Go to _Connect_ -> _App Store_ and click on _Create an app_ in the top right corner.
- Give your app a name, for example "Blackbird".
- The activate URL is irrelevant for Blackbird, you can give it the Blackbird login URL like `https://de-1.blackbird.io`.
- For the callback URL fill in `https://bridge.blackbird.io/api/AuthorizationCode`.
- You will receive a `Client ID` and a `Client Secret`. Copy and save these values for the next steps.

## Actions

### General

- **Get all locales** returns a list of locale codes that are available on this Akeneo instance. *Note*: Akeneo does not have a default locale.

### Products

-   **Search products** returns a list of products based on filter criteria, for example product name, categories and updated date.
-   **Delete product** deletes a specific product.
-   **Get product info** returns details about a specific product.
-   **Update product info** updates details of a specific product.

-   **Download product content** returns all localizable product values for a specified locale in an HTML format (by default). When translated, this file can be used by the **Upload product content** action to upload translations to Akeneo. Optionally this method can also output raw json files of the product structure.
-   **Upload product content** updates product content values from a translated or otherwise processed file that originated from the action above. Also accepts json files.

### Product models

-   **Search product models** returns a list of product models based on filter criteria, for example code, categories and updated date.
-   **Delete product model** deletes a specific product model.
-   **Get product model info** returns details about a specific product model.
-   **Update product model info** updates details of a specific product model.

-   **Get product model as HTML** returns all localizable product model values for a specified locale in an HTML format.
-   **Update product model from HTML** updates product model content values from a provided HTML file.

All products and product models return information about categories. You can use this to make detailed decisions on localization strategies.

## Events

### Products

-   **On products created or updated** triggers when new products are created or updated. You can filter by locale and categories.
-   **On product models created or updated** triggers when any product models are created or updated. You can filter by locale and categories.

## Example

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9eb04458-1d84-4b6f-9450-97b59b60c729)

The above example shows a very simple manually triggered bird that translates certain products using DeepL.

In the above example we respond to new products being updated or created, creating new memoQ projects for them and uploading the translatable files to memoQ.

## Missing features

Akeneo is a huge app with a lot of features. If any of these features are particularly interesting to you, let us know!

In particular we can offer localization capabilities for other aspects of Akeneo like Categories.
