Uniform is a composable Digital Experience Platform (DXP) designed for enterprise digital marketing teams. It allows users to create omnichannel digital experiences by integrating various content, data, and technology sources.

## Before setting up

Before you connect your Uniform instance to Blackbird, make sure you have the following:

- A Uniform instance with access to team settings
- Team admin permissions to create API keys
- Project ID for the project you want to work with

### How to create an API key

1. Open your team page in Uniform at https://uniform.app
2. Navigate to **Security > API Keys**
3. Click **Add API key**
4. Enter a name for your API key (note: you cannot change the name after creation)
5. Configure permissions:
   - For most uses, select **Role assignment** and inherit permissions from existing roles
   - For CLI or CI/CD operations, you may need **Team admin** access
   - Alternatively, assign **Custom permissions** for specific project needs
6. Click **Create API Key**
7. Copy and save the following values (they will only be displayed once):
   - **Key**: Your API key
   - **Project ID**: The project identifier
   - **Quick Connect**: A combined string with all connection details

> **Warning**: The API key and Quick Connect values are only displayed once. Save them securely before closing the dialog.

More details can be found in the [Uniform documentation](https://docs.uniform.app/docs/guides/api-keys).
