MemoQ CMS is a platform that streamlines workflows by providing efficient job submission, processing, and delivery within the memoQ Server environment, enhancing overall translation management capabilities.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have [memoQ installed](https://www.memoq.com/downloads).
- You have created connection and obtained your _Base URL_ and _Connection key_. Information about connection establishment can be found in the [_memoQ Server CMS API documentation_](https://docs.memoq.com/current/api-docs/cmsapi/CMS%20Gateway%20REST%20API%20v2.00.pdf?_gl=1*nqna0h*_ga*ODg3NDQ5Njc0LjE3MDExNjIwMjY.*_ga_HHK0YX9VVW*MTcwMTI0MzUxMS4zLjAuMTcwMTI0MzUxMS4wLjAuMA..*_ga_TVK7MSKW78*MTcwMTI0MzUxMS4zLjAuMTcwMTI0MzUyMC4wLjAuMA..*_gcl_au*MTM3Njk1OTc2NC4xNzAxMTYyMDI1#page=13&zoom=100,90,94) under the _2.3.1. CMS connection lifecycle_ and _2.3.2. CMS connection management_ sections.

2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My organization'.

## Actions

### Orders

- **List orders**. Orders can be optionally filtered using input parameters.
- **Get order**.
- **Create order**. Leave the _Callback URL_ parameter unspecified if you intend to use **On job completed** and/or **On job cancelled** events.
- **Commit order** changes the status of an order to _Committed_ which means that all jobs of the order have been submitted.

### Jobs

- **List jobs** returns the translation jobs of the specified order.
- **Get job**.
- **Create job** creates a new translation job in the specified order. Note that you cannot add a new job to an order with a _Committed_ status.
- **Download translation** downloads the translation for the specified job. The job must be in the _In Delivery_ or _Delivered_ state before the translation can be downloaded.
- **Deliver job** changes the status of a job to _Delivered_.

## Events

- **On job completed** and **On job completed (manual)** are triggered when a job is completed, signifying that translation is ready and can be downloaded.
- **On job cancelled** and **On job cancelled (manual)** are triggered when a job is cancelled.
