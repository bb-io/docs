Figma is a cloud-based design and collaboration platform that specializes in user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design. It provides a powerful, browser-based vector graphics editor that enables teams to create, prototype, and iterate on digital products in real time. Figma’s platform is known for its intuitive interface, seamless collaboration features, and ability to keep designers, developers, and stakeholders aligned throughout the entire product development process.
