Webflow is a cloud-based web design and development platform that enables users to create, customize, and manage responsive websites visually. It provides a wide range of features and tools for designers, developers, and businesses to build and maintain professional websites without needing to write code. Webflow allows users to publish websites directly, collaborate in real-time, and utilize a robust CMS to manage content. This makes it a versatile solution for individuals, entrepreneurs, and enterprises looking to establish and grow their online presence.

## Before connecting

This app supports three types of connections: **OAuth2**, **OAuth2 (multiple sites)** and **Site Token**. You can choose whichever option works best for you. Note that a Site Token limits requests to the site where the token was generated, while OAuth2 allows you to work with multiple sites simultaneously.

1. Ensure you have an active Webflow account. If not, create one here: [here](https://webflow.com/signup).
2. Confirm that at least one site exists in your Webflow account.

### OAuth2

1. Open **Apps & Integrations** in Webflow and create a new application.

![create app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/Webflow/main/image/README/Create-app.png)

2. Provide the application details (name, description and URL can be customized). In **Building blocks**, enable **Designer extension** and **Data client (REST API)**. 
Configure the OAuth redirect URL with: 'https://bridge.blackbird.io/api/AuthorizationCode'. Then select the required scopes.
