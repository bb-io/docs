Webflow is a cloud-based web design and development platform that enables users to create, customize, and manage responsive websites visually. It provides a wide range of features and tools for designers, developers, and businesses to build and maintain professional websites without needing to write code. Webflow allows users to publish websites directly, collaborate in real-time, and utilize a robust CMS to manage content. This makes it a versatile solution for individuals, entrepreneurs, and enterprises looking to establish and grow their online presence.
