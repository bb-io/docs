Sitecore is one of the leading enterprise-level content management systems, enabling web content editors and marketers to have full control over all aspects of their website from social integration and blog posts to advanced personalisation, ecommerce and more. This app focusses on the integration between Sitecore items, languages and the rest of the Blackbird ecosystem. Contrary to other Blackbird apps, in order to get up and running you need to install a custom-built plugin on your Sitecore instance.

This app is built for Sitecore XM Cloud. For Sitecore XP see [this guide](https://docs.blackbird.io/apps/sitecore-xp/) instead.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have access to XM Cloud Deploy, its credential management and an active Sitecore project.
- You have access to the source code repository (Github) of a Sitecore project and the ability to configure new plugins.
- You have downloaded the latest Blackbird Sitecore plugin package from [here](https://docs.blackbird.io/sitecore/package.zip).

## Installing the plugin

Assuming your source content repository is forked form this [repo](https://github.com/sitecorelabs/xmcloud-foundation-head).

1. Extract the files from [package.zip](https://docs.blackbird.io/sitecore/package.zip)
2. Copy the 2 config files from `package\files\App_Config\Include\BlackBird` in the package to `authoring\platform\App_Config\Include\` in the source code repository.
3. Copy the 2 dll files from `package\files\bin` in the package to `authoring\platform\_dlls` in the source code repository.
4. Open the `XmCloudAuthoring.sln` in Visual Studio (or any other .NET compatible IDE) and add references to the added .dll files in the Platform project. Also include file references to the 2 config files and set them to copy always. The project should now contain the references:

```xml
[...]
   <ItemGroup>
      <Reference Include="Microsoft.CSharp" />
      <Reference Include="Sitecore.BlackbirdIntegration, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, processorArchitecture=MSIL">
         <SpecificVersion>False</SpecificVersion>
         <HintPath>_dlls\Sitecore.BlackbirdIntegration.dll</HintPath>
      </Reference>
      <Reference Include="Sitecore.BlackbirdIntegration.WebApi, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, processorArchitecture=MSIL">
         <SpecificVersion>False</SpecificVersion>
         <HintPath>_dlls\Sitecore.BlackbirdIntegration.WebApi.dll</HintPath>
      </Reference>
      [...]
   <ItemGroup>
[...]
   <ItemGroup>
      <Content Include="App_Config\Include\Sitecore.BlackbirdIntegration.config">
         <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
      </Content>
      <Content Include="App_Config\Include\Sitecore.BlackbirdIntegration.WebApi.config">
         <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
      </Content>
      [...]
  </ItemGroup>
```

Your solution should look something like this now:

6. Build and/or push your code so that a redeployment is triggered.

## Creating an API key

1. Go to _Content Editor_.
2. Navigate to _System -> Settings -> Services -> API Keys_.
3. Insert a new API Key item.

4. Populate the following fields:
   - Allowed controllers: set to _\*_ or choose controllers.
   - Impersonation User: the request will be executed as this user. Sitecore admin can create users with some limitations if needed. Anonymous users will be impersonated as this user if the field value is empty or wrong. Make sure you input this value as sitecore\username.
5. Publish the item.

6. Copy the Item ID (including the parentheses) - this is your key and can be used in the next steps.

## Creating an XM Cloud Client

1. In XM Cloud, go to the [credentials tab](https://deploy.sitecorecloud.io/credentials).
2. Click _Create credentials_ and add a recognizable label.
3. Copy the _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_ for next steps.

## Connecting

1. Navigate to apps and search for Sitecore XM Cloud.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My Sitecore connection'.
4. Fill in the base URL to your Sitecore instance.
5. Fill in the API key from the _Creating an API key_ section.
6. Fill in the Client ID and Client Secret from the  _Creating an XM Cloud Client_ section.
7. Click _Connect_.

## Actions

- **Search items** Finds items based on specified search criteria such as last updated date, creation date, language, path, and more. You can narrow down results with various filters to locate exactly what you need. Note that 'Workflow' and 'Current workflow state' values will only be populated when you provide the optional 'Workflow state ID' input parameter - otherwise these fields will return null. The optional parameter 'Include all subitems' controls the search depth: when set to true (default), the search includes all descendant items under the root path; when set to false, only direct children of the root path are included.
- **Get workflow state** Get workflow state of an item. This action retrieves the workflow state of a specific item, which is useful for understanding the current status of the item in the workflow process.
- **Get all configured languages** returns all the languages that are configured in this Sitecore instance.
- **Download item content** get the content of an item represented as an HTML or JSON file so that it can be processed by NMT or TMS. You can specify which version/language should be retrieved.
- **Upload item content** updates the content of a specific version/language from the file exported using _Download content item_ action. Additionally, you can choose to always create a new version.
- **Delete item content** deletes an item.
- **Get Item ID from file** retrieves the item ID from the HTML/JSON content. When you get the item content as a file, we will add the Item ID to the header of the file, this action allows you to receive the Item ID from the document.

## Events

- **On items created** Polls for items that have been created since the last poll.
- **On items updated** Polls for items that have been updated since the last poll.
- **On items assigned to workflow state** Polls for items that currently have a specific workflow state. This event returns all items with the specified workflow state, regardless of whether they appeared in previous polls. To avoid processing the same items repeatedly, use the **Update workflow state** action after processing each item. For example, you might poll for items in the "Ready for localization" state, process them, and then update their workflow state to "In translation" or "Translation completed".

> Important: The events are not real-time, they are polling events. You can set the polling interval through the UI. The default is 1 hour, minimal is 5 minutes.

## Example

This example shows how one could retrieve a subset of items, based on custom criteria, download these items HTML files, translate them using any NMT provider and update the translations.
