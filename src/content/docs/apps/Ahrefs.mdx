This Bird automatically reacts when Ahrefs suggests a new keyword. It then goes through relevant Zendesk articles and downloads the content, sending it to OpenAI to be enriched or optimized with the keyword. The improved version is then re-uploaded to Zendesk. In short, this Bird keeps your help center articles continuously updated and SEO-friendly based on fresh keyword opportunities.
