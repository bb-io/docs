Marketo is Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)-based marketing automation software owned by Adobe and built to help organizations automate and measure marketing engagement, tasks and workflows.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have a Marketo account on the instance you want to connect to.
- Your Marketo account has the right permissions. You need to have the account with "API user" role to setup a connection.

## Connecting

1. Navigate to apps and search for Marketo. If you cannot find Marketo then click _Add App_ in the top right corner, select Marketo and add the app to your Blackbird environment.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My client'.
4. Fill in the "Munchkin Account ID", "Client ID" and "Client secret" of your Marketo instance you want to connect to. You can find it in Marketo settings
5. Click _Authorize connection_.
