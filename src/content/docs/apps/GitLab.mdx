GitLab, is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, and manage their code. This GitLab app focusses on connecting GitLab events and file actions into the Blackbird ecosystem.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have a GitLab account.
- You have owner permissions on the repository you want to automate on.

## Connecting

1. Navigate to apps and search for GitLab. If you cannot find GitLab then click _Add App_ in the top right corner, select GitLab and add the app to your Blackbird environment.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My GitLab connection'.
4. Click _Authorize connection_.
5. Follow the instructions that GitLab gives you, authorizing Blackbird.io to act on your behalf.
6. When you return to Blackbird, confirm that the connection has appeared and the status is _Connected_.

## Events

### Pulls

= **On pull request action** occurs when there is activity on a pull request. See [this page](https://docs.GitLab.com/en/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#pull_request) for more info.

### Pushes

- **On commit pushed** occurs when there is a push to a repository branch. This includes when a commit is pushed, when a commit tag is pushed, when a branch is deleted, when a tag is deleted, or when a repository is created from a template.
- **On files added** is triggered when new commits have new files. It returns the paths to all added files.
- **On files modified** is triggered when new commits modify files. It returns paths to all modified files.
- **On files added or modified** is triggered when new commits add new files or modify files. It returns paths to all these files.
- **On files removed** is triggered when new commits remove files. It returns paths to all deleted files.

For the file specific events, a path parameter can be specified in order to narrow down the event to only files in specific folders or files that have certain extensions. Use the forward slash '/' to represent directory separator. Use '\*' to represent wildcards in file and directory names. Use '\*\*' to represent arbitrary directory depth.

For example: when you want to create an event that triggers only when .html files are modified in a folder called _locales_. Then the path of the **On files added or modified** event should be: _/locales/\*.html_

## Example

The following bird creates a new memoQ project whenever files are updated or added to a specific folder in a GitLab repository.
