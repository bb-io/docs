## Before setting up

- You can find the `Base URL` of your Magento URL. It can look like `https://magento.testing.organization.com/`
- For receiving the `Consumer key`, `Consumer secret`, `Access token` and `Access token secret` you need to create a new integration in your Magento account. You can do this by going to `System` -> `Extensions` -> `Integrations` -> `Add new integration`. After creating the integration you will receive the `Consumer key`, `Consumer secret`, `Access token` and `Access token secret`. Note, that you don't need to provide any values for the `Callback URL` and `Identity link URL` fields. You can select all the available resources for the integration to avoid any issues with the permissions. Or select the resources that you need for your specific use case. See the current available functionality of the app below in the documentation.
