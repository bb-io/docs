Lara is a new adaptive translation AI that combines the fluency, reasoning, context handling and instruct capabilities of LLMs with the low hallucination rate and latency of MT. On top of this, Lara is adaptive which means that Lara does not require training, instead is able to adapt to any domain on the fly leveraging previously translated content or context.
