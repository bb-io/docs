[Phrase Language AI](https://support.phrase.com/hc/en-us/articles/5709660879516-Phrase-Language-AI-TMS) specializes in language translation services. It offers a  machine translation (MT) engine capable of providing high-quality translations across multiple languages and ability to understand context.
Phrase Language AI can be used for raw machine translation workflows that require high volumes of translation without any post-editing steps.
The minimum requirement for using Phrase Language AI via API is the Phrase Portal user role.
Phrase Language AI enables file-based translation for the following file types: `.DOCX`, `.TXT`, `.XLSX`, `.CSV`, `.PPTX`, `.HTM/.HTML`, `.XML`, `.JSON`, `.MD`, `.XLF/.XLIFF`, `.SDLXLIFF`.

### MT Autoselect Supported Languages

MT Autoselect supports domain-based recommendation for all documents in these source languages:
- English
- Czech
- German
- Spanish
- French
- Italian
- Japanese
- Korean
- Dutch
- Russian
- Swedish
- Chinese Simplified

All other language combinations get MT Autoselect recommendations but do not take text domain into account.

### Domains 

The type of content translated with machine translation can significantly affect the quality of the output. An engine that might perform well for product descriptions might struggle with a medical report. The content type variable is known as a domain.
Categorizing documents into domains is normally a process that requires human input, creating complications when it comes to scaling translation and allows for basic human error.
Domains were created automatically using an AI-powered analysis of documents. An unsupervised machine learning algorithm recognized 11 distinct types of documents that shared similar sets of keywords:

| Domain                         | Keywords                                                |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|

| Travel and Hospitality         | km, hotel, guests, room, accommodation                  |
| Business and Education         | team, business, work, school, students                  |
| Legal and Finance              | agreement, company, contract, services, financial       |
| Software User Documentation    | click, select, data, text, review, file                 |
| Consumer Electronics           | power, battery, switch, sensor, usb                     |
| Customer Support               | account, email, account, domain, contact                |
| Cloud Services                 | network, server, database, sql, data                    |

| Software Development           | value, class, type, element, string                     |
