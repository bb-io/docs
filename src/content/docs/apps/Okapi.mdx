Longhorn is a server application that allows you to execute Batch Configurations remotely on any set of input files. Batch Configurations which include pre-defined pipelines and filter configurations, can be exported from Rainbow.

## Connecting

1. Navigate to apps and search for Okapi Longhorn. If you cannot find Okapi Longhorn, click **Add App** in the top right corner, select Okapi Longhorn, and add the app to your Blackbird environment.
2. Click **Add Connection**.
3. Name your connection for future reference, e.g., 'My Client'.
4. Go to your Okapi Longhorn server.
5. Copy its URL, for example: `http://28.216.252.148:88/okapi-longhorn`.
6. Paste it into the appropriate field in Blackbird.
7. Click **Connect**.
8. Confirm that the connection has appeared and the status is **Connected**. If this stage fails, ensure that you do not have a firewall blocking the connection, or configure your firewall to allow traffic from the Blackbird server.

## Actions

### XLIFF conversion actions

This combination of actions allows you to convert any Okapi-compatible file to XLIFF and back. Use it in combination with other Blackbird apps that take or modify XLIFF files.

- **Convert file to XLIFF** takes any Okapi-compatible file format and converts it to an XLIFF file. It outputs both an XLIFF and a 'package' file.
- **Convert XLIFF to file** takes a (modified) XLIFF file and a package file, it returns the original file.

### Manual batchconfig actions

Use the following actions to have full control of batchconfig executions on one or multiple files

- **Upload files**: Uploads files to a specific project. This action will upload each file provided in the request, handling them based on their file types, including special handling for ZIP files.
- **Create project**: Creates a new project within the system, returns the ID of the newly created project, and uploads a batch configuration file.
- **Execute project** Executes the batch configuration on the uploaded input files, returns the output files
