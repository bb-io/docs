## Actions

### Translation

- **Create text translation** create a translation based on a given text. The translation is queued and will be processed by Translated. For a detailed explanation of all options see the [TranslationOS documentation](https://api-sandbox.translated.com/v2#tag/Translate/operation/translate).
- **Create file translation** behaves the same as a text translation, but with a file input.
- **Update translation** updates an existing translation request
- **Cancel translation** cancels an existing translation request

## Events

- **On translation finished** is triggered when a translation is finished. When setting up this event in a bird you are presented with a Callback URL. Copy this URL and use it in translation creation actions across Blackbird to direct these translations to this bird.
