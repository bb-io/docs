### XLIFF actions

- **Process XLIFF** processes the XLIFF file and returns updated XLIFF with the translated content. By default it will translate source and place the translation in the target field. But you can modify behavior by providing your custom `prompt`
- **Post-edit XLIFF file** action is used to post-edit the XLIFF file.
- **Get Quality Scores for XLIFF file** action is used to get quality scores for the XLIFF file by adding `extradata` attribute to the translation unit of the file. Default criteria are `fluency`, `grammar`, `terminology`, `style`, and `punctuation`, but you can add your own by filling `prompt` optional input.

### Batch actions

- **(Batch) Process XLIFF file** asynchronously process each translation unit in the XLIFF file according to the provided instructions (by default it just translates the source tags) and updates the target text for each unit.
- **(Batch) Post-edit XLIFF file** asynchronously post-edit the target text of each translation unit in the XLIFF file according to the provided instructions and updates the target text for each unit. 
- **(Batch) Get Quality Scores for XLIFF file** asynchronously get quality scores for each translation unit in the XLIFF file.
- **(Batch) Get XLIFF from the batch** get the results of the batch process. This action is suitable only for processing and post-editing XLIFF file and should be called after the async process is completed.
- **(Batch) Get XLIFF from the quality score batch** get the quality scores results of the batch process. This action is suitable only for getting quality scores for XLIFF file and should be called after the async process is completed.
