Gemini is a cutting-edge, multimodal AI from Google, capable of reasoning across various media, driving chatbots, search enhancements, productivity tools, and device-level interactions.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have selected or created a [Cloud Platform project](https://console.cloud.google.com/project).
- You have [enabled billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project) for your project.
- You have [enabled the Vertex AI API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=aiplatform.googleapis.com).
- You have created a service account and generated JSON keys.

### Creating service account and generating JSON keys

1. Navigate to the selected or created [Cloud Platform project](https://console.cloud.google.com/project).
2. Go to the _IAM & Admin_ section.
3. On the left sidebar, select _Service accounts_.
4. Click _Create service account_.
5. Enter a service account name and, optionally, a description. Click _Create and continue_. Select the _Vertex AI Administrator_ or _Vertex AI User_ role for the service account and click _Continue_. 
![Creating service account](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/GoogleVertexAI/main/image/README/access.png)
6. . Click _Done_.
7. From the service accounts list, select the newly created service account and navigate to the _Keys_ section.
8. Click _Add key_ => _Create new key_. Choose the _JSON_ key type and click _Create_.
9. Open the downloaded JSON file and copy its contents, which will be used in the _Service account configuration string_ connection parameter.

## Connecting

1. Navigate to apps and search for Google Gemini AI. If you cannot find Google Gemini AI then click _Add App_ in the top right corner, select Google Gemini AI and add the app to your Blackbird environment.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My organization'.
4. Fill in the JSON configuration string obtained in the previous step.
5. Choose the necessary region.
6. Click _Connect_.
7. Confirm that the connection has appeared and the status is _Connected_.

## Actions

### Generation

- **Generate text** generates text using Gemini model. If text generation is based on a single prompt, it's executed with the gemini-1.0-pro model. Optionally, you can specify an image or video to perform generation with the gemini-1.0-pro-vision model. Both image and video have a size limit of 20 MB. If an image is already present, video cannot be specified and vice versa. Supported image formats are PNG and JPEG, while video formats include MOV, MPEG, MP4, MPG, AVI, WMV, MPEGPS, and FLV. Optionally, set _Is Blackbird prompt_ to _True_ to indicate that the prompt given to the action is the result of one of AI Utilities app's actions. You can also specify safety categories in the _Safety categories_ input parameter and respective thresholds for them in the _Thresholds for safety categories_ input parameter. If one list has more items than the other, extra ones are ignored.

- **Generate text from file** the input can take an additional file.

### Translation

- **Translate** translate file content retrieved from a CMS or file storage. The output can be used in compatible Blackbird interoperable actions.
- **Translate text** given a text and a locale, tries to create a localized version of the text.

### Editing

- **Edit** Edit a translation. This action assumes you have previously translated content in Blackbird through any translation action. Only looks at translated segments and will change the segment state to reviewed.
- **Edit Text** given a source segment and translated target segment, responds with an edited version of the target segment taking into account typical mistakes.

### Deprecated XLIFF

- **Get Quality Scores for XLIFF file** Gets segment and file level quality scores for XLIFF files. Optionally, you can add Threshold, New Target State and Condition input parameters to the Blackbird action to change the target state value of segments meeting the desired criteria (all three must be filled).

    Optional inputs:
	- Prompt: Add your criteria for scoring each source-target pair. If none are provided, this is replaced by _"accuracy, fluency, consistency, style, grammar and spelling"_.
	- Bucket size: Amount of translation units to process in the same request. (See dedicated section)
	- Source and Target languages: By defualt, we get these values from the XLIFF header. You can provide different values, no specific format required. 
	- Threshold: value between 0-10.
	- Condition: Criteria to filter segments whose target state will be modified.
	- New Target State: value to update target state to for filtered translation units.

    Output:
	- Average Score: aggregated score of all segment level scores.
	- Updated XLIFF file: segment level score added to extradata attribute & updated target state when instructed.

- **Post-edit XLIFF file** Updates the targets of XLIFF file

	Optional inputs:
	- Prompt: Add your linguistic criteria for postediting targets.
	- Bucket size: Amount of translation units to process in the same request. (See dedicated section)
	- Source and Target languages: By default, we get these values from the XLIFF header. You can provide different values, no specific format required.
	- Glossary

- **Process XLIFF file** given an XLIFF file, processes each translation unit according to provided instructions (default is to translate source tags) and updates the target text for each unit.

- **Get MQM report from XLIFF file** Perform an LQA Analysis of the translated XLIFF file. The result will be in the MQM framework form.

- **Get translation issues from XLIFF file** Analyzes an XLIFF file to identify translation issues between source and target texts

Note, that all XLIFF actions supports 1.2 and 2.1 versions of the XLIFF format, since these versions are the most commonly used in the industry. If you have a different version, please let us know and we will consider adding support for it.
At the current moment models "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25" supports global and us-central1 regions, "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17" supports us-central1 region.

### Important Notes on XLIFF Processing

> **Performance with Large XLIFF Files**: Based on our experience, Gemini models may struggle with XLIFF files containing more than 100 translation units. Performance can be inconsistent - sometimes working well but often producing hallucinations (returning only one translation unit when 50 were sent) or breaking formatting. For more reliable XLIFF processing, we recommend using alternatives like OpenAI or Azure OpenAI apps. Also, consider specifying a `Bucket size` of 15-20 or lower to ensure the model can handle the workload effectively.

> **Optimizing Performance**: If you need to use Gemini for XLIFF processing, try adjusting the `Max output tokens` optional parameter. Setting this to the highest value available for your model may improve results, though be aware this will increase the cost of the action.

### Bucket size, performance and cost

XLIFF files can contain a lot of segments. Each action takes your segments and sends them to the AI app for processing. It's possible that the amount of segments is so high that the prompt exceeds the model's context window or that the model takes longer than Blackbird actions are allowed to take. This is why we have introduced the bucket size parameter. You can tweak the bucket size parameter to determine how many segments to send to the AI model at once. This will allow you to split the workload into different API calls. The trade-off is that the same context prompt needs to be send along with each request (which increases the tokens used). From experiments we have found that a bucket size of 1500 is sufficient for models like gpt-4o. That's why 1500 is the default bucket size, however other models may require different bucket sizes.
