Azure OpenAI Service provides access to advanced language models that you can customize for conversational AI, content creation, and data grounding.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have the `Resource URL` for your Azure OpenAI account.
- You know `Deployment name` and `API key` for your Azure OpenAI account.

You can find how to create and deploy an Azure OpenAI Service resource [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal).

## Connecting

1. Navigate to Apps, and identify the **Microsoft OpenAI** app. You can use search to find it.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My Microsoft OpenAI connection'.
4. Enter the `Resource URL`, `Deployment name`, and `API key` for your Azure OpenAI account.
5. Click _Connect_.
6. Verify that connection was added successfully.

## Actions

### Chat actions

- **Generate completion**: Completes the given prompt.
- **Chat**: Gives a response given a chat message.
- **Chat with system prompt**: Gives a response given a chat message and a configurable system prompt.
- **Create summary**: Summarizes the input text.
- **Generate edit**: Edit the input text given an instruction prompt.
- **Execute Blackbird prompt**: Execute prompt generated by Blackbird's AI utilities.

### Translation-Related Actions

- **Post-edit MT**: Review MT translated text and generate a post-edited version.
- **Get translation issues**: Review text translation and generate a comment with the issue description.
- **Get MQM report**: Perform an LQA Analysis of the translation. The result will be in the MQM framework form.
- **Get MQM dimension values**: Perform an LQA Analysis of the translation. This action only returns the scores (between 1 and 10) of each dimension.
- **Translate text**: Localize the text provided.

### Audio Actions

- **Create English translation**: Generates a translation into English given an audio or video file (mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, wav, or webm).
- **Create transcription**: Generates a transcription given an audio or video file (mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, wav, or webm).

### Image Actions

- **Generate image**: Generates an image based on a prompt.

### Text Analysis Actions

- **Create embedding**: Generate an embedding for a text provided. An embedding is a list of floating point numbers that captures semantic information about the text that it represents.
- **Tokenize text**: Tokenize the text provided. Optionally specify encoding: cl100k_base (used by gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo, text-embedding-ada-002) or p50k_base (used by codex models, text-davinci-002, text-davinci-003).

## Example

Here is an example of how you can use the `Microsoft OpenAI` app in a workflow:

![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/MicrosoftOpenAI/main/image/README/example.png)

This workflow automates the process of handling a specific trigger in Slack. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. On app mentioned (Slack): The workflow starts when the app is mentioned in a Slack channel.
2. Find translation issues (Blackbird Prompts): It then uses Blackbird Prompts to find translation issues in the mentioned content.
3. Build prompt: Next, it constructs a prompt based on the identified issues.
4. Chat (Microsoft OpenAI): The constructed prompt is sent to Microsoft OpenAI to generate a response or solution.
5. Send message (Slack): Finally, the response from OpenAI is sent back as a message in the Slack channel.
