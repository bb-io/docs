Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models from leading AI companies like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Stability AI, and Amazon with a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications, simplifying development while maintaining privacy and security.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have an [AWS root user account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html) or [IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_identity-management.html) created by root user for you.
- You have an access key and secret generated for your IAM user.
- You have access to models you want to use. You must request access to a model before you can use it. If you try to use the model before you have requested access to it, you receive an error.

### Create IAM user

- Go to [Identity and Access Management](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home).
- Select _Users_ from the left sidebar.
- Click _Create user_.
- Enter _User name_ and click _Next_.
- Select _Attach policies directly_ option from _Permissions options_.
- Add _AdministratorAccess_ and _AmazonEC2FullAccess_ policies, then click _Next_.
- Review user details and permissions, then click _Create user_.

### Generate access key

- Go to [Identity and Access Management](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home).
- Select _Users_ from the left sidebar.
- Select the user for whom you want to generate an access key.
- Go to the _Security credentials_ tab.
- Scroll down to the _Access keys_ section and click _Create access key_.
- Select _Use case_ and click _Next_.
- Enter _Description tag value_ and click _Create access key_.
- Save _Access key_ and _Secret access key_ values to be able to connect to Amazon Bedrock via Blackbird.

### Add model access

- Open the [Amazon Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock).
- Change region to _US East (N. Virginia)_ in the top right corner.

![Change region](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/AmazonBedrock/main/image/README/region.png)

- Select _Model access_ from the left sidebar and click _Edit_.
- Select the models you want to have access to and click _Save changes_.
- Models will show as _Access granted_ under _Access status_, if access is granted.

## Connecting

1. Navigate to apps and search for Amazon Bedrock. If you cannot find Amazon Bedrock then click _Add App_ in the top right corner, select Amazon Bedrock and add the app to your Blackbird environment.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My organization'.
4. Fill in the access key and secret obtained in the previous section.

## Actions

- **Generate image with Stability.ai Diffusion** generates text with Stability.ai Diffusion model or any custom model that is based on Stability.ai Diffusion model.
- **Generate text with AI21 Labs Jurassic-2** generates text with AI21 Labs Jurassic-2 model or any custom model that is based on AI21 Labs Jurassic-2 model.
- **Generate text with Meta Llama 2** generates text with Meta Llama 2 model or any custom model that is based on Meta Llama 2 model.
- **Generate text with Anthropic Claude** generates text with Anthropic Claude model or any custom model that is based on Anthropic Claude model.
- **Perform an LQA analysis with Anthropic Claude** uses pre-engineered prompt to conduct a Language Quality Assessment analysis of the translated text using the Anthropic Claude model.
- **Generate text with Cohere Command** generates text with Cohere Command model or any custom model that is based on Cohere Command model.
- **Generate embedding** generates embedding vector for a text provided. An embedding is a list of floating point numbers that captures semantic information about the text that it represents. Embeddings can be used to store data in vector databases (like Pinecone).
