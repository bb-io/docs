TAUS EPIC API helps users assess the quality of machine-translated content and make informed decisions about its suitability for various purposes.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have a TAUS account.
- You have an API key corresponding to your TAUS account. You can find API keys [here](https://www.taus.net/user/epic-api/keys)

## Actions

### Segments

- **Estimate** Gets quality estimation data for a single segment specifying: - Source text - Source language - Target text - Target language -
  Supported languages can be found [here](https://developer.taus.net/). TAUS' sandbox environment only supports :

- English (en)
- French (fr)
- German (de)
- Italian (it)
- Spanish (es)

### XLIFF files

- **Estimate XLIFF** Gets quality estimation data for all segments in an XLIFF 1.2 file. Mandatory input data include the translated XLIFF file, source and target language values. As an output, an Average Score is provided, which is the average of the quality scores for all segments in the file. Additionally, all translation units get appeneded with their individual score which is added to the `extradata` attribute in the XLIFF file. Optionally, you can add Threshold, New Target State and Condition input parameters to the Blackbird action to change the target state value of segments meeting the desired criteria.

Examples:

Setting the optional input values as shown in the image below will result in all segments with a score above 0.9 to have their target state values updated to "final".

Similarly, the setup below will cause all the segments with a quality score below or equal to 0.6 to have their target state value changed to "needs-review-translation".

![TAUSoptionalinput2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/Taus/main/image/README/TAUSoptionalinput2.png)

The files should meet the following requirements:
- max 1000 segments per file
- file size maximum 262 kb
