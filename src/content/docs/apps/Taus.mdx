## Actions

### Review

- **Review** review a translated content file returned from other content processing actions. Adds quality scores to each segment.
- **Review text** reviews translated text and returns a quality score

### Editing

- **Edit** a translated file. This action assumes you have previously translated content in Blackbird through any translation action. Only looks at translated segments, first applies an MTQE pass and when the score is below the threshold will do an edit. Remarks about edits are added to segments as notes.
- **Edit text** given a source segment and translated target segment, responds with an edited version of the target segment taking into account typical mistakes.
