Adobe Workfront is a cloud-based work management solution designed to help teams and organizations efficiently plan, track, and manage their work. It streamlines project management, task collaboration, resource management, and portfolio management across various teams and departments. Additionally, it serves as a leader in enterprise work management, enabling teams to connect, collaborate, and simplify workflows to deliver personalized experiences at scale. With features that support large enterprises, Adobe Workfront helps in building a centralized marketing system of record.

## Before setting up

Before you connect to Adobe Workfront, make sure you have the following:

- An active Adobe Workfront account with sufficient permissions to create projects, tasks, and users.
- Your Workfront instance must be **web-accessible** from the Blackbird platform (e.g., no restrictive firewall blocking access).
- Your **Workfront domain (base URL)**. This is usually in the form:  
  `https://yourdomain.my.workfront.com`
- An **OAuth2 application** created inside Workfront. The OAuth2 application will provide you with a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, which are required to set up the connection in Blackbird.

To create an OAuth2 application in Workfront:

1. Log in to your Workfront instance.
2. In the top-right corner, click the **grid icon** (the square of dots) and select **Setup**.

3. In the left-side menu, expand **System** and select **OAuth2 Applications**.

4. Click **Create app integration**.
5. In the **New OAuth2 application** dialog, select **Web Application** as the authentication method.

6. Enter a name for the application (e.g., *Blackbird*).
7. In the **Redirect URIs** section, add the following URI: `https://bridge.blackbird.io/api/AuthorizationCode`

8. Adjust **token expiration settings** according to your needs
9. Add client secret by clicking on **Add client secret** button.

10. After creation, copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

> ⚠️ Important: The **Client Secret** is only shown once. Store it securely. If lost, you will need to generate a new secret by editing or recreating the app.

Once you have your **Base URL**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret**, you are ready to set up the connection in Blackbird.

## Connecting

1. Navigate to **Apps** in Blackbird and search for **Adobe Workfront**.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference, e.g., **My Workfront**.
4. Fill in the following fields:

   - **Base URL**: Your Workfront instance URL.  
     Example: `https://your-adobe-workfront-domain.com`

   - **Client ID**: The Client ID you obtained when creating your OAuth2 application in Workfront.

   - **Client Secret**: The Client Secret you obtained when creating your OAuth2 application in Workfront.
     > ⚠️ Important: This value is shown only once during app creation in Workfront. Make sure you have stored it securely.

5. Click _Connect_.
6. Confirm that the connection has appeared and the status is **Connected**.

## Example

Here’s an example of how to set up a support workflow with `Slack` and `Adobe Workfront` that will automatically create a Workfront task from a client request in Slack and then return the response back to the client in Slack once the task is completed.

![Slack-Workfront example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bb-io/AdobeWorkfront/main/docs/assets/example.png)

* The workflow starts with the `On app mentioned` event in Slack. When a client mentions the app in Slack with a request, the event is triggered.
* The `Chat` action with OpenAI is used to process the client’s message and generate a suitable task title.
* The `Create task` action in Adobe Workfront creates a new task using the generated title.
* The `On task status changed` event in Adobe Workfront monitors the status of the created task. When the task is marked as completed, the flow continues.
* The `Get string custom field value` action retrieves the content of a custom field called **Answer to client** from the completed task.
* Finally, the `Send message` action in Slack sends the value of **Answer to client** back to the original Slack thread, providing the client with the requested response.
