- Enter a name for your API key and click on "Create" button.

## Actions

### Speech

- **Convert text to speech** Convert provided text to a speech with selected settings (In order to keep working correctly, cinsider the input limit 2-3 sentences, if bigger input used it may return corrupted URL)

### Project

- **Create project** Create a new project
- **Get project** Get project details
- **Search projects** Searches projects

### Batch (Platform-created)

- **Create batch** Create a new batch

**Attention**: Batch actions are considered platform-created, so the process does not return a Request ID because downloads via API are not supported.
