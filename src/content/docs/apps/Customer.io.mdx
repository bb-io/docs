Customer.io is a platform that enables businesses to send targeted and personalized messages to their customers via various communication channels such as email, SMS, and push notifications.

## Known Customer.io API limitations

### Drag-and-Drop editor content cannot be translated

Customer.io's API does not support translating content created with their drag-and-drop editor. This is an API limitation that affects all newsletters and broadcast messages created using the drag-and-drop editor.

Unfortunately, the API does not provide a way to automatically notify you if content was created using the drag-and-drop editor.

**How to identify this issue:**

When attempting to download or update translations, the body content may not be retrieved or updated correctly.

**Workaround:**

To enable translation of newsletter content:

1. Export the HTML from the English version of your email
2. Create a new broadcast or newsletter in Customer.io
3. Select **"Code"** as the content type (not drag-and-drop)
4. Paste the exported HTML into the Code editor
5. Copy the title and pre-header from the original newsletter
6. Use Blackbird to download and translate the content as normal

**Important:** While your content team can continue authoring emails using the drag-and-drop editor, they will need to manually copy the content to a "Code" email before it can be localized through Blackbird or any other automation.

This limitation applies to all email messages created with drag-and-drop editor:
- Broadcast messages
- Newsletters
- Campaign messages
