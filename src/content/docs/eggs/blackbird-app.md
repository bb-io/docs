### Eggs: Starting Points for Your Birds

In Blackbird, Eggs are the seeds or blueprints for your workflows. They represent the initial ideas that have the potential to become fully-fledged Birds.

In this Egg-guide, let's explore some options to monitor and get notified whenever something happens in your Blackbird instance in a centralized fashion. Find **Downloadable Eggs** after each use case.

## Stay in the Loop with the Blackbird App

With so many Nests, Birds, users and Flights in action, it’s easy to lose track of the flock. Blackbird was designed to soar quietly in the background, automating your workflows without requiring constant check-ins. But what happens when a Bird is suspended, a user joins or leaves a Nest, or a Flight takes a nosedive? That’s where the Blackbird app comes in! Think of it as your trusty watchtower, keeping an eye on all the activity in your Blackbird instance. Whether it’s logging updates in a spreadsheet or chirping notifications straight to Slack, Teams, or Outlook, the Blackbird app ensures you’ll never miss a beat—or a tweet.

## Use cases

### Error notification or tracking

The most popular use case for the Blackbird app in Blackbird is monitoring failed Flights. You can receive real-time notifications containing key details such as the error message, Nest name, Bird name, Flight ID, and start date. Alternatively, you can log these failed Flights in a spreadsheet for later review or to populate dashboards.

> Use optional inputs to monitor a specific Nest, otherwise a single Bird will monitor all Nests within your Blackbird instance.
