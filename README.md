# Blackbird documentation

Build with Astro starlight. [Read the reference documentation](https://starlight.astro.build/).

## Project Structure

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## Generating apps

To generate apps run `npm run generate`

The script goes through all repositories in our organization and looks for readme files with `<!-- begin docs -->` and `<!-- end docs -->` comments. All content within these comments is copied into a markdown file in `/src/content/docs/apps`
